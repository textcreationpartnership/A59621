            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have obſerved among all the Arts and Engines the old Enemy hath made uſe of, none have proved ſo beneficial and expeditious, as thoſe two mentioned <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. 20. The one <hi>to call Evil Good, the other to put Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Light.</hi> By the firſt he caſts a miſt before our Eyes, when he tempts to ſin, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall not die, but ſhall be as Gods,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Evil to appear Good, that we may ſin with <hi>leſs fear;</hi> and by <hi>putting Darkneſs for Light and Light for Darkneſs,</hi> when we have by his ſollicitations faln into ſin, he puts a Vail upon our Conſciences, that we may either lie ſtill more ſecurely, or go on more boldly, when he hath furniſht us with ſome ſpecious Excuſes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>over our nakedneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:50777:3"/> and ſins deformity; thus leading poor Souls blind-folded as thoſe Syrians once were, who (ſuppoſing themſelves conducted by a friend, and in a ſafe way) were led into the mouth of danger, and no ſooner were their Eyes opened, but they were ſenſible of their groſs miſtake.</p>
            <p>With theſe two did he begin the World, when he ſet up for himſelf, and affected the Principality of this Lower World, having failed in his higher Aym above, aſpiring to more greatneſs among his fellow Angels.</p>
            <p>And ſo beneficial have they proved to him, that he may (as if laughing) at his own policy and man's ſimplicity, ſay to his Aſſociates, what once that Atheiſtical Name-ſake and Vicegerent of his <hi>Leo X.</hi> ſaid to one of his Cardinals, <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>antum nobis &amp; noſtro Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui profuit illa fabula, &amp;c.</hi> The curſed Atheiſt ſpake it of the very Goſpel it ſelf. How much have we and our Colleagues gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Fable? But by the way had he ſaid, how much have thoſe two Fables profited us, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Peters Supremacy,</hi> and the Keys delivered to him alone, and of Romes <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as ſucceeding <hi>Peter</hi> in all his Apoſtolical priviledges, he had not ſaid much amiſs; for theſe have been the Popes <hi>two Keys</hi> by which he hath opened the way to his <hi>Vice-Godſhip</hi> on Earth (he is ſo ſtyled by
<pb facs="tcp:50777:3"/> his Canoniſts and Paraſites, <hi>Vice-Deus in Terris)</hi> and to his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy over the blinded Chriſtian World, trampling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the very Necks of Kings and Emperours. Theſe are the two main ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Antichriſtian Kingdom, and the <hi>Rocks</hi> on which the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is founded. So thoſe two fore-named <hi>black Arts</hi> have been the Keys by which the Prince of Darkneſs hath opened his way to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the World, and hath arrived to his wiſhed <hi>Supremacy</hi> too: to his Godſhip in the World (ſo is he called 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Deus hujus ſaeculi)</hi> and hath attained his deſired <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy, trampling upon high and low, and triumphing over the <hi>deluded</hi> ſons of men. So that he who ſhall ſhake theſe two Pillars, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did thoſe two on which the Philiſtins houſe was built, will throw down the <hi>ſtrongeſt holds</hi> of Satan, and make his Kingdom fall about his Ears, and will deſerve his Name ſhould be enrolled among the Chief of Chriſtian Heroes. And as <hi>David</hi> ſaid once of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jebus</hi> who had put ſuch ſcorn upon him, He that <hi>ſhall get up into the Gutter, and take away the lame and blind which are hated of</hi> Davids <hi>Soul, he ſhall be Chief, and Captain,</hi> 2 Sam. 5. 8. So may I ſay, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall take away the <hi>Blind and Lame.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50777:4"/> The <hi>blind</hi> pretences whereby <hi>Evil is called Good:</hi> And the lame Excuſes where <hi>Light is put for Darkneſs,</hi> deſerves in my mind the Name among the <hi>firſt Three,</hi> as he that hath done moſt to the taking away the Reproach of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by diſarming the <hi>ſtrong man, and taking away his Armor wherein he truſted, and ſpoiling his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have laid my weak hand to this latter, and have endeavoured (I will not ſay <hi>Pro virili,</hi> ſed pro <hi>Senili,</hi> pro Imbecilitate &amp; tenuitate mea) <hi>for as the man is, ſo is his ſtrength,</hi> Jud. 8. 21.) to give it a ſhake, or may rather ſay, have been as that weaker guide to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> led him to the two Pillars, where he may try his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of my own many Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and therefore might well put in <hi>my Excuſe</hi> (had I not profeſſedly written againſt Excuſes) for adventuring to appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in this Critical, Learned, and Eagle-eyed Age; my Weakneſſes are many, Stile homely, Method, happily not ſo well digeſted, and by ſome I look to be Cenſured as having ſaid too much, by others too little. I have only this for Excuſe, and ſome Excuſes you will ſee are here allowed, that I have not met with much written deſignedly on this Subject, which may in ſome ſort Excuſe both Author and Matter, and Manner, and Method, and
<pb facs="tcp:50777:4"/> Stile, and the many other Infirmities which the whole Diſcourſe may labour under.</p>
            <p>I have taken notice of above an <hi>hundred</hi> Bad Excuſes, and have ſpoken ſomewhat to the <hi>Reproving,</hi> I would I could alſo ſay to the <hi>Removing</hi> of them. And another I doubt not, of more Inſight into the wayes of God and wiles of Satan, may come after and glean an hundred more (and his Gleaning better than all my Vintage) and yet this <hi>Hydra</hi> hath more Heads than can eaſily be cut off. Some I have willingly pretermitted to eaſe my ſelf and thee <hi>Reader</hi> in ſome ſort, and have only touched upon ſome, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to inlarge upon all, then ſhould I have written a Volume and not ſo ſhort a Treatiſe, the variety and number of the particulars is ſo great, that to ſpeak fully and ſatisfactorily to each, would require a workman indeed, and I might have known where to begin, but not where to end.</p>
            <p>I have here gathered and ſet a many <hi>Stocks,</hi> which a more skilful <hi>Hortulane,</hi> would have ſet in a better and more comely Order, and likely have graffed better fruit upon, more pleaſant to the Eye and Taſt of the Reader, by a more ſubſtantial handling, a more ſmooth, pithy and taking ſtile, and a more gracious and ſpiritual ſtrain of Spirit.</p>

            <p>Theſe are the great <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon</hi> the Deſtroyers of Souls, the Mice that near the Land, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 5.

Excuſes they are Satans <hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> Sins great <hi>Grandmother,</hi> that came in with the Fall, begotten between Sin and Guilt, Sin the Father, Guilt the Mother: God created Man upright it is ſaid, but Man (faln) ſought out many Inventions; among which, Excuſes to cloke and cover Sin were the first and are the chiefest.

            <p>They are the old <hi>Primitive Language</hi> learnt of Satan in Paradiſe, and though other Languages have been lost, or ſo confounded that we hardly know what remains of them, this remains entire and may be called the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Character</hi> of the World and the Mother Language of all Nations, who as ſoon as born, and learn to go and ſpeak; learn to go aſtray and ſpeak Lies. An Evil ſo much the more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented becauſe Hereditary &amp; Connatural, born with us. No Nation ſo barbarous, Religion ſo groſs, Worſhip ſo impious, Superſtition ſo fond, Manners ſo brutiſh, Opinion ſo irrational, but hath borrowed ſomwhat from Excuſes to defend them: No Age, Sex, Nation, Condition, ſort and rank of men without them. The youngest Child, hath learned one and the elder Father more, none ſo ſimple and ignorant as to be deſtitute of one, and the more knowing and cunning (the more the pity) the more ſtore.</p>

If I never do worſe, I hope I ſhall do well enough: Have not others done as bad or worſe, yet found mercy? I have Examples, great ones, multitude on my ſide,
<pb facs="tcp:50777:8"/> and ſome good men have done the like. It is my <hi>Diana</hi> (my Livelyhood) my <hi>Dalilah,</hi> (or right Eye) allow me this only, I ſhall do any thing, only ſpare me <hi>Herodias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>2. If we deal with men to confeſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Sins, how many ſhifts, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings? how long e're we can get that hard word <hi>Peccavi</hi> out of their mouths.

Bear with me I pray, it was an Over-ſight I confeſs, but I hope my Nature, Cuſtom, Paſſion, Provocation may Excuſe me: Or it was done in my Ignorance, Childhood, or when I was not my ſelf; but then in my Drink, Heat, Anger, Paſſion, Fear, Haſt, and on the ſudden. Another ſaith, it was in Jest, Mirth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Merriment, I had no ill meaning in the Earth; another, had I not reaſon? I was wronged, urged, abuſed, and it was to an Enemy or a worthleſs perſon. Another, what I did was in zeal and out of Conſcience to make good my Vow, Promiſe; Oath which I had taken;
<pb facs="tcp:50777:8"/> my Welfare, Credit, Honour, lay at ſtake, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, danger and prejudice was prevented, my Friend pleaſured, much good procured: Beſides I tell you again it is the only Infirmity I am ſubject to; my <hi>Rimmon,</hi> herein the Lord be merciful to me, I know not how to leave it, or live without it, and it is hard if a man have but One Ewe Lamb in his Boſome, and the Miniſter would deprive him of that. Beſides the matter is not ſo great, I am not an Adulterer, Murderer or perjured perſon, it was but once neither. I ſhould have been ſingular, unſociable, hiſſed at, had I done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I am civil, take pains for my Living, pay every man his own, I trust the Lord will be more merciful, then theſe Miniſters tell us, or God help us; what will become of all elſe? and twenty more ſuch put-offs men have.</p>
            <p>3. If we cannot but yield it to be a Sin, then have we other Excuſes ready, If it was Evil blame others, not me; I am a Child, did as my Parents bade me; a Servant, and must do what my Maſter commands and keep his Secrets; in a low condition, and my dependence was on ſuch whom I must not diſoblige. I am of ſo good a Nature as I can't be refractory, if I am any bodies foe, it is my own, no mans elſe, if I ſpend, it is but my own, what my Friends left me, or I came fairly by. I had Commands to warrant, Promiſes to allure,
<pb facs="tcp:50777:9"/> Threats to fright, Friends and Companions to importune, Examples and multitudes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me, and could I ſtand againſt all theſe. If <hi>Hercules</hi> thought it hard to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with two, how could I ſtand before ſo many <hi>Hercules's?</hi> Beſides what ſome ſcrupulous perſons (more preciſe then wiſe) cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is the cuſtom of the Countrey, the mode of the time, place and ſociety that I converſe with, and the moſt men I meet with do the like, and it were hard if God ſhould condemn all the World, but a few who are ſingular, and love to pleaſe themſelves, though they pleaſe no body elſe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:50777:9"/> of life; then do they flatter themſelves, and reply, Is not God infinite in mercy? did not Chriſt die for Sinners? The promiſes of the Goſpel are full of Comfort, and I ground my Faith on them, and ſuch doctrines as are preached by our beſt Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Free Grace, of Juſtification by Faith, Remiſſion of Sins, and Pardon upon true Repentance; and a great obſervation I have made, I hope I ſhall never forget it, the bleſſed End I have ſeen ſome make without all this ado.</p>
            <p>6. Stir them up to a purſuit of Holineſs, and a Conſcientious courſe of Life, how are they ready to plead the badneſs of the times, the diſrepute Holineſs is in, the Inconveniences, Damage, Detriment, Diſgrace we may meet with; <hi>He that departeth from Evil, maketh himſelf a Prey:</hi> The Aſperſions &amp; Nick-names caſt upon the Godly, the troubles and tentations of the Righteous, the Lyon in the way, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties in the way of Salvation. The peace, and proſperity of the wicked, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among Profeſſors, the ſcandalous Lives of ſome Miniſters, and the foul miſcarriage of ſome Profeſſors, and many ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, warn them to take heed of Security, and to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, they have their anſwer ready; Gods Decrees are unchangeable, if I am Elected I ſhall be ſaved, if not, I ſhall periſh whatſoever
<pb facs="tcp:50777:10"/> I do, all endavours are in vain, all good works we are taught do neither merit grace, nor glory.</p>
            <p>So again, when we call upon men to duty, to come in and receive Chriſt; How do all with one conſent make Excuſe? my Calling, Oxen, Farm, Merchandize, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and give me time; the work is good I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I ſpeak not againſt it, but the time is not yet; I am a Child, ignorant, an unlearned perſon, I have a full purpoſe hereafter, when more at leaſure, when out of debt, ſettled in the world, when I have buried my aged Father, and my ſelf my own man, and my eſtate in my own hand; but let me alone till then, or till I am old, ſick, dying, and then I will do what you will have me.</p>
            <p>So again when we perſwade men to believe; how backward and ſlow of Heart are many to embrace the Promiſes, rejecting and in as much as in them is fruſtrating the grace of God, with ſuch like put-offs; the Promiſe is good, and too good for me, I too bad, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy, neither holy, nor humble enough, the means are unlikely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or I fear it is now too late, the day of Grace is paſt, the Decree is gone forth, Providences are dark, Promiſes delayed, my ſins, afflictions, fears, doubts, temptations great and dreadful, Satan aſſaults, dogs, inſults, triumphs, and which is ſaddeſt
<pb facs="tcp:50777:10"/> of all, God hath forſaken me, my Prayer are not heard, the Viſion doth not ſpeak, my Fleſh fails, my Heart fails, and my Hope is even gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>I might go on, Reader, thus to enlarge and multiply particulars, but muſt crave thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this tediouſneſs; if either thou deſireſt more, or art not at leiſure to read the whole, let me adviſe thee to turn to Chap. 9, 10, 11. and ſeriouſly conſider what thou there readest of the veariety, vanity, ſinfulneſs and danger of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes. But here thou ſeeſt enough to convince thee how common and frequent Excuſes are, and how juſtly to be ſpoken againſt. All the world is undone by them, nothing but Excuſes, Excuſes every where. Every man hath his Omer full. So that call for what you will, and put men upon what you will, all you muſt look for, is to be put off with an Excuſe. As he ſaid once, To will is preſent, to perform I find not, ſo to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is preſent, to perform I find not an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To fly from, repent of, and turn from ſin, requireth pains; to perform the duties of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs requires pains; to exerciſe Faith and Patience, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth pains, and ſo the whole of Real Chriſtianity, but an Excuſe is eaſie, cheap, and coſteth little.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, trouble thee no longer Reader, but deſire God to give us all his grace to avoid all ſinful and <hi>deſtructive</hi> Excuſes, and that in
<pb facs="tcp:50777:11"/> ſtead of theſe, we may get our ſelves furniſht with ſome of thoſe <hi>Better Excuſes</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the end of this Diſcourſe, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular theſe five I would commend at preſent in ſtead of all others.</p>
            <p>First, that of a good Conſcience; then thou needeſt no other, of which Saint <hi>Bernad</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Optima C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ique Excuſatio eſt Teſtimonium Conſcientiae:</hi> The beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of all, is an Excuſing Conſcience. This was St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Excuſe. Our rejoycing is this, <hi>The teſtimony of our Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. It is above a thouſand Witneſſes we ſay, and I may add above ten thouſand Excuſes. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls it the ſaving anſwer of a good Conſcience, and prefers the vertue of it above that of Baptiſme alone, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>2. Next to that, ready, ſincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience; then no need of any deviſed Excuſe, when thou canſt ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> My righteouſneſs ſhall anſwer and ſpeak for me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 33. and with the Apoſtle, we have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſs (as Excuſe-makers do,) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe Conſcience may yet accuſe, and our Obedience falls ſhort, the next good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is Humiliation and Repentance, timely and true. <hi>Shemei</hi> after all his foul-mouthed rayling and curſing, ſped better at <hi>David's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50777:11"/> hands by his making haſt to humble himſelf and crying mercy, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 20. then that leſs guilty <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who brought a Crown coming in his confidence of good Service, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 5. And the ſelf-condemning Publican at Gods hands, than the ſelf-juſtifying Phariſee. Neither were any received to mercy at <hi>Joſuah's</hi> hands, but the ſelf-humbling, mercy-begging <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> all that ſtood upon their defence were cut off.</p>
            <p>4. With humble Confeſſion and Proſtration joyn fervent Prayer. This was <hi>David's</hi> Excuſe or Relief, Againſt thee have I ſinned, turn thy face from my ſins; and the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I have taken away thy Sin. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſation and Repentance with Prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abſolution and remiſſion. This is the Apology <hi>or ſelf-clearing</hi> mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. If we therefore cannot come in with the elder Brothers Apology, I have ſerved thee theſe ſo many years, neither tranſgreſſed at any time, then come in with the younger Brothers confeſſion and ſupplication, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, above all, fly to Christ by Faith, that he may make thy Excuſe by interceding for thee: His Office is to mediate, reconcile
<pb facs="tcp:50777:12"/> and plead for us as our Advocate, to undertake for us our Surety, to take away Sin as our Propitiation, then what need of Excuſes wheas Sin is taken away? through him we ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unblamable &amp; unchangeable before God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 22. Ar thou therefore overwhelmed with Sin, Guilt, Fear and Diſmaydneſs, cry to him as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 14. <hi>Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me,</hi> and with the words of the expiring Thief, <hi>Lord remember me now thou art in thy Kingdom,</hi> Luke 23. 42.</p>
            <p>And now I have no more to do, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to God, and to the word of his Grace, and to intreat thy favourable acceptance of this Diſcourſe (ſuch as it is) and to pray that thou maiſt make thy best of it.

               <p>Divide the World into three parts: The <hi>firſt and beſt is the leaſt,</hi> of ſuch as gladly receive the Goſpel, and ſay with <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, thy Servant heareth,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 10. or with St. <hi>Paul, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> A little Flock of theſe, there are but few of them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Acts 5. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>God rather than Men.</hi> But our Diſcourſe is profeſſedly about bad Excuſes, I therefore paſs thoſe over.</p>
               <p>Evil Excuſes are of <hi>three ſorts,</hi> relating 1. To <hi>Sin.</hi> 2. <hi>Duty.</hi> 3. <hi>Faith.</hi> We begin with ſuch as refer to Sin, and ſuch are of two ſorts. 1. Such as are <hi>homebred,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from ſelf. 2. Some <hi>extraneous,</hi> and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from others.</p>
               <p>They are very many that relate to all theſe Heads; I intend not an enumeration of all (that were almoſt endleſs) but take notice of ſuch as are moſt obvious.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, to begin with thoſe <note place="margin">1. <hi>Denying the Fact.</hi>
                  </note> that refer to Sin: The firſt Excuſe I ſhall take notice of, is, <hi>to deny the Fact.</hi> Not I, not I, is the old Put-off. Little leſs was that of our firſt Parents, when queſtioned about the firſt Tranſgreſſion; Not I, but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Not I, but the Serpent. The like <hi>Judas</hi> his impudent Reply, <hi>Is it I? q. d.</hi> Who will ſay it is? But moſt palpable that of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who by one Lie told in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50777:21"/> Maſters name, got of <hi>Naaman</hi> two great Bags of Silver, as much or more than he could carry, and two Changes of Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reckoned with himſelf what Purchaſes he ſhould make of Olive-yards, Vineyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when he came back to his Maſter with another Lie in his Mouth, (as one Lie leads to another) <hi>Thy Servant</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>went no whither,</hi> (as denying the Fact) he received a ſad Doom, <hi>The Leproſie of</hi> Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>ſtick to thee, and to thy Seed for ever.</hi> A fit and juſt Brand for the Liars Forehead. Had every Liar one ſuch, there would be many a foul Face to be ſeen in the Streets. But how ordinary is it with young and old, Servants and Children, when done amiſs, to deny the fact, thinking thereby to excuſe and extenuate the fault, which doth but aggravate it, and of one fault makes two, as our Divine Poet,</p>

Yet alas! how ordinary is it for men to ſeek to cover ſhame with ſin, and to hide a leſs, run into a greater ſin, which will be ſure to find them out, and lay them open at laſt? As in caſe of Robbery, to conceal the Theft, Murder is committed; and often after one Murder committed, a ſecond or a third follows; as if Blood could be covered with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50777:34"/> Blood. And in the caſe of <hi>Baſtardy,</hi> how dreadful, yet how ordinary is it for the unnatural Parents, ſet on by the inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil, to lay violent hands on their own innocent Births! Thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that ſin, which was bad enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (yet pardonable) now a crimſon ſin, and unpardonable. Many Publicans and Harlots have repented and found mercy: but Blood is a crying ſin, and calls for Vengeance. Murderer is the Devils firſt Title, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. But with what fearful aggravations is this <hi>Infanticidium,</hi> murder of Infants, over-charged above any other almoſt? Murder of any kind is dreadful; but wilful and deliberate, much more. The caſual murder might, the wilful might not be pardoned: But to murder an Innocent, <note place="margin">Numb. 35. 31.</note> that could never wrong any, what barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inhumanity this! And if any in the world may be called Innocents, Infants moſt properly. Yet to do this with thy own hands, who art the Father or Mother, and oughteſt by the Law of Nature to preſerve thy Young, Tygres and Bears will riſe up againſt thee, and condemn thee. This is an act of ſo deep a dye, that no words can ſet it out with horror enough: An act not onely barbarous and inhumane, but an unnatural, and in a good
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50777:34"/> ſenſe I may call it an <hi>unbruitiſh</hi> act. This worſe than thy former ſin: Thy Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a bruitiſh, this a deviliſh act. Yet alas! how doth Satan hurry on theſe poor Creatures from ſin to ſin, bearing them in hand this is the onely way for ſecurity and ſecreſie? Whereas this is that which makes all break out, and that with a vengeance too. The onely way had been to <hi>flie to that fountain opened for ſin and uncleanneſs, Zach.</hi> 13. 1. and to go into the loweſt Form of humble Penitents, as did that noted ſinful Creature once, who had not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to look Chriſt in the face, but came behind him, and, not preſuming to touch his head, waſhed his feet with her peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial tears, (the beſt Pattern in the world for ſuch Offenders) who had ſuch acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, that her Saviour ſaid to her, <hi>Her</hi>

                  <hi>add ſin to ſin.</hi> This dreadful Woe will certainly purſue and overtake ſuch kind of Offenders, of whoſe Practice it is ſo lively a deſcription. 1. After ſuch foul ſins of Murder, Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is nothing but <hi>taking counſel</hi> and deviſing how to keep it cloſe: They conſult with Fleſh and Blood, conſult with Sin and Satan: <hi>They take counſel, but not of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>They cover with a Covering.]</hi> That is all which is deſired, not a Cure but a Cover, not a Pardon, but a palliating and cloaking of Sin: This way is thought of, and that way, and a Covering they muſt have, but <hi>not of my Spirit;</hi> of the evil Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be. So 3. They <hi>add ſin to ſin,</hi> which is the third thing noted, and worſt of all: They enquire not how law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but, will it cover ſhame? That is all they look after: Sin is nothing with them, and ſin upon ſin, and wrath upon wrath; their onely buſineſs is how to keep off ſhame. Thoſe two Harlots, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. were Saints to theſe Miſcreants, who both ſtrove for the living Child, neither would own the dead Child.</p>

                  </note> takes hold of what I ſaid laſt, and thinks I have made his Excuſe for him: For though, ſaith he, I am a great Sinner; yet for the <hi>good parts</hi> God hath beſtowed on me, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50777:41"/> for the <hi>good Duties,</hi> and the many other <hi>good things</hi> I perform; ſetting the one againſt the other, I may not only paſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, but gain an Approbation. Thus <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 14.</note> that vile Strumpet thought to paſs with her Devotions: She had been confeſſed, abſolved, done her Pennance, paid her Vows, therefore might ſin afreſh. Thus <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 14.</note> the Phariſee, when he had made a prey of a poor Widow, thinks his ſin expiated by a long Prayer, which he meant to ſay ere he went to Bed. And thus, I fear, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors now a-days, for whom my Heart bleeds; who, like the <hi>Inn-Keeper,</hi> cleanſe their Rooms in the Morning, to be fouled again by all Comers ere Night: Or like the <hi>Monks,</hi> who have their <hi>Mattins</hi> and <hi>Even-ſong,</hi> and all day do what they liſt, only with this difference; The one mock God, in ſaying what they underſtand not; And the other deceive themſelves in plain Engliſh, praying that which they after mind not. But as one ſaid once, Tell me not what the man is in Affliction, but what after: So ſay I, Tell me not what a man is in Duty, but what after it.</p>
               <p>Again, there are others who think to expiate their many Sins in their Life, by doing ſome notable act of Charity at their Death, by their Goods ill gotten. Debts
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50777:42"/> are to be paid before Legacies; and Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is to go before Charity, as we ſee in <hi>Zacheus.</hi> We ſpeak not againſt good works, but would have them done in a good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they may redound to the good of the Donor.

                  <note place="margin">Eſay 61. 8. Deut. 23. 18.</note> and the price of a Dog, or the hire of a Harlot, was not to come into his Offering. Remarkable is that ſtory of <hi>Selimus</hi> he Firſt, who, near his end, was counſelled by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Baſſa, to lay out a great maſs of Treaſure, taken from <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchants, upon a notable Hoſpital for the Poor; No, ſaith he, God forbid I ſhould beſtow thoſe Goods ſo ill gotten, upon Works of Charity and Devotion, for mine own vain-glory and praiſe: I will never do it, but command, that they be all reſtored to the right Owners. It is true indeed, wicked men may do ſome magnificent acts, much cryed up by men, yet nothing avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Doer.

They are ready to anſwer, Though I can't talk ſo well, and have not ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet for <hi>a Heart to God-ward,</hi> I have as good as the beſt: I have ſo ſtrong a Faith, as I never yet doubted; and for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, I do, and ever did <hi>with all my heart.</hi> Poor Souls, thy Heart good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, is as an Eye good without ſight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. Tell me thou haſt a ſtrong Faith, and a Heart full of love to God, when thy life and talk is looſe and vain; and perſwade me thou heareſt Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when I ſee it ſnows: The one is not more the old man's wonder, then this the Chriſtians, Or that the Spring is ſweet, when the water's bitter; Or that the Tree is a Pear-tree, when it beareth Bramble-Berries; Or that the man is ſound, who is alway Coughing in my Ears, and ſpits up his Lungs and putrid matter in my ſight. As is the Treaſure of the Heart, ſuch is the Communcation and Converſation: Tell this to thy Child, not to me. Thy Child
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50777:43"/> would perſwade thee, he loves thee with all his heart, and will ſtrike on his Breaſt when thou askeſt him, Where he loves thee; yet let him have an Apple, ask him to give it, or a part of it; or bid him go into the next Room, if dark, to fetch thee any thing, he ſhrinks and ſhrugs, but will do neither. So if the Lord bid thee part with the leaſt ſin, or go into the darks of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and mortifying any luſt; thou flingeſt away, and wilt do neither.

                  </note> Saints, recorded in Scripture, and their practice, we think, may warrant us. But we muſt diſtinguiſh of their actions, that we may ſafely imitate them. 1.

And this it was: At <hi>Antioch Peter</hi> had converſed familiarly with the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till certain came from <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then did he with-draw Communion from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> fearing belike the <hi>Jews</hi> would take offence; the like did <hi>Barnabas:</hi> They were both to blame. <hi>Paul</hi> comes thither, and foreſees whither this halting and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation might tend, <hi>viz.</hi> to endanger and undermine the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and to confirm the <hi>Jews</hi> in a pernicious ſticking
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50777:50"/> to their old Ceremonies, now antiquated and aboliſhed: He therefore ſtands up to vindicate the Truth, not caring who is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, ſo truth may be maintained, <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cephas, Amicus Barnabas; Cephas</hi> is a Friend, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> a Friend; but Truth is more then all Friends. <hi>Peter</hi> upon the debate was convinced, and no hurt came of this Diſſenſion, but much good: And they parted Friends. It were to be wiſht all will ſay, That there were no differences among Chriſtians, no diſcrepancies among Preachers; <hi>but that all did think and ſpeak</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note>

The ceremonial, dark and typical Worſhip of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and the Evangelical is not the ſame: I give but a hint, more inſtances might be given. All compliance with the godly, is not alwayes godly compliance; unleſs Saints were either infallible at all times, or at that time have truth on their ſide; otherwiſe they are ſure as like to miſcarry, as a <hi>Peter</hi> or a <hi>Barnabas.</hi> There

The Serpent beguiled me,</hi> ſaid the woman; <hi>There's for Satan:</hi> There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but excuſe upon excuſe, and ſin upon ſin: Yet did not this avoid the juſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt both, for it was their own voluntary act; Satan might perſwade, did not compel. One ſaith, the Devil as a ſly Serpent deceived me; another, as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion affrighted me; a third, as a fell Dragon, caſt a flood of temptations out of his mouth, and over-whelmed me; a fourth, as a reſtleſs Friend, he dogged and haunted me, I could never be quiet for him. All this excuſeth not, the ſin is thy own; ſollicite and entice he may, compel he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: Thy will he hath no power over, but by thy own conſent. The faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, betruſted by his Prince with keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fort, thinks it not enough to hold no Correſpondence with the Enemy; but when he aſſaults him with his Batteries, he manfully repels him, makes up his Breaches, prevents his Underminings, ſeeks to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him; prevents his nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Sallies out againſt him, ſpends all his Darts and Ammunition againſt him, endures all Extremities; and when he fears, and wants Supplies, ſends to his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50777:62"/> Prince and is relieved. So it is with us, not enough to ſay, I was tempted, enticed, aſſaulted, winnowed, buffeted, dogged; but we ſhould take the whole armor of God, make reſiſtance, watch, pray, take the ſhield of Faith, cry out, and ſend to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for aſſiſtance, as <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> with him is an Arm of Fleſh, but with us is the Lord of Hoſts to fight our Battels; and with him it is all one to ſave with ſtrength, or with them that have no might, as <hi>Aſa</hi> ſaid, <note place="margin">2 Chron. 14. 11.</note> Help us, O Lord our God, for we reſt on thee; Help us againſt this Enemy: And in thy Name we go out againſt him. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Devil,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <p>WE have done with Excuſes (as to <note place="margin">3. <hi>Excuſes taken from other things.</hi>
                  </note> ſin) taken from <hi>our ſelves</hi> and other <hi>perſons:</hi> We come now to ſpeak of ſuch as are taken from <hi>other things,</hi> of which there are ſo many (Reader) that I do not promiſe thee to enumerate all, but ſuch as are moſt common and obvious. And firſt, <hi>Ignorance</hi> is a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">1. <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </note> pretence; and were it really ſo, it might paſs for a juſt defence: As when <hi>Abimelech</hi> was charged to be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> he <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 15.</note> avowed he was altogether ignorant of any ſuch thing, it was, or ſhould have been accepted as a clear purgation. But igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is oft made a Cloak to <hi>careleſneſs,</hi> and wretched neglect of duty belonging to our places.

                  <hi>deliver them that are drawn to death, and ſayſt, Behold we knew it not: Doth not he that pondereth the heart conſider; and ſhall not he render to every man according to his works?</hi> q. d. This is a poor ſhift, a meer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50777:63"/> put-off; Conſcience is not ſo acquitted: Thou mayſt pretend thou waſt not there, hadſt other buſineſs, or ſome indiſpoſition of Body, but thou ſhouldſt have been there. If <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had not opened his mouth on Chriſt's behalf, when he was traduced, <hi>John</hi> 7. 51.

                  </note> there are ſome ready to plead their <hi>Place and Office</hi> for excuſe, that muſt bear them out. Thus did <hi>Naaman</hi> plead, <hi>When the King goeth into the houſe of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>leaneth on my hand,</hi> (for that is my place at Court) <hi>and I bow in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon <hi>as doth the King, the Lord be merciful to me,</hi> and hold me excuſed herein. The like alſo might <hi>Pilate</hi> have pleaded, if that would excuſe him: My Place is to releaſe one at the Feaſt, though a Murderer, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the moſt Innocent, if the people ſhall importune it. Thus alſo no queſtion did thoſe perſecuting Biſhops in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s dayes flatter themſelves, when they burnt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50777:64"/> thoſe Innocents: We have taken an Oath to the Pope, and our Place tyes us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them to the Flames, whom the Pope declareth Haereticks. And when they gave Sentence, they ſaid, They did it <hi>ex Officio;</hi> that is, by vertue of their Office.

Beſides, the Laws of men, ſaith he, never pretend to the government of the Thoughts, Heart, Spirit, and inſide of the man; in which lies the chief, both of Grace and Sin, Vertue and Vice, which the Law of God doth principally take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. The <hi>Adequate</hi> object of the good Subjects Obedience is the Law of the Land, but the <hi>Adequate</hi> object and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the good Chriſtians Obedience is the Law of God. And therefore though the Subjects conformity to the Laws of men abſolve him in humane Courts, and procure him the common benefit of the King's Peace; yet it is conformity to the Law of God, which procures ſpiritual peace of Conſcience before God. So that if you enquire in a civil and political ſenſe, <hi>Vir bonis eſt quis?</hi> Who is the good man? The anſwer is, <hi>Qui conſulta patrum, qui</hi>

               <p>2. There is another ſort of men, when charged with rigor, and hard dealing with their Neighbours, (men of a perverſe and contentious ſpirit) are ready to make their defence; I do but <hi>what the Law will bear me out in:</hi> who can blame me for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, and taking what advantage the Law will give me? my Neighbour ſhall have Law and Juſtice at my hands, and what he can recover by Law. But we have a common ſaying, <hi>Summum jus ſumma in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria,</hi> Extremity is extreme hard; Extreme right, is extreme unrighteouſneſs. We Chriſtians have a Command, That our <hi>moderation ſhould be made known to all men:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 5.</note> We are to be a Law to our ſelves, above the Laws of Men, under the Law of God. Conſider Chriſtian, if the Lord ſhould ſay to thee and me, you ſhall have Law and Juſtice, what you can claim by the Law, and no more: Both you and I were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally undone. Remember, with what <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 2.</note> meaſure thou meteſt, it ſhall be meaſured

                  <hi>without Mercy, who hath ſhewed no Mercy:</hi> And mercy both in God and all good men ſhould triumph over Judgment. Do not thou therefore take thy Fellow-Servant by the Throat for the <hi>hundred pence,</hi> when thou lyeſt obnoxious to the Juſtice of God for <hi>ten thouſand Talents</hi> (as it is in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) leaſt he, for thy extremity, deal in juſt extremity with thee, and caſt thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 34.</note> Priſon, till thou ſhalt ſatisfie for the whole Debt.</p>
               <p>12. Another ſort of men make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, <note place="margin">It is my own, and I may do what I pleaſe with that.</note> 
                  <hi>It is my own, and may I not do with my own what I will?</hi> what hath any man to do with me in ſuch caſe? This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſative plea of two contrary kinds of men.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſaith, If I ſpend high, and make all away, what is that to any man? I may do with my own as I think good. So ſaith the Miſer, If I keep all in my Cheſt, and live below my ſtate, what is that to any man? <hi>All is Ours,</hi> ſay both; I ſay neither; Nothing is ours: Nor are we our ſelves our own, ſaith the Apoſtle; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>h. e.</hi> at our own arbitrary diſpoſe, no nor yet our States: we are Stewards and Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries. <hi>The Silver and Gold is mine,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 8. Hoſ. 2. 9.</note> the Lord: Thy Wooll, Flax, Wine, Oyl,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50777:71"/> mine. <hi>Nabal</hi> was as much Fool as Churl, when he talked ſo much of <hi>his</hi> Bread, <hi>his</hi> Cheeſe, <hi>his</hi> Victuals; none muſt taſte of his Cheer but himſelf and his own Domeſticks. The Law of Men will queſtion neither the Prodigal or Miſer, God will: The Lord will enquire what good thou haſt done with thy State. There are two Queſtions that all whom God hath given Eſtates to, ſhould ſtudy to make a good Anſwer to: 1. <hi>The one is,</hi> How cameſt thou by it? was it by honeſt labour, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious diligence in thy Calling, and God's bleſſing therewith: Then much good may thy State do thee, and much good mayſt thou do with it. But if by ſycophantizing, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> call'd it, by bribery, extortion, grinding the face of the Poor, falſe Weights and Meaſures, detaining the Labourers Hire, or Servants Wages, racking Tenants, &amp;c. Thy State is not thy own, nor did God give it thee. Thou haſt <hi>Achan</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed wedge in thy Tent: This is <hi>aes Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Thou muſt reſtore with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> if thou wouldſt have Salvation come to thy houſe. The <hi>next queſtion</hi> is, How thou haſt kept or employed thy Talent: The Miſer thinks he is ſafe enough, he got it hardly, and keeps it charily; makes no idle expences, nothing ſpent in Taverns,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50777:71"/> Cards or Dice, or coſtly Entertainments: But he keeps what he hath got, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth it daily, as if this was the only Talent that God would call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. Thy State is not yet thine, till thou haſt as well the Uſe as the Poſſeſſion <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quo mihi fortunas, ſi non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceditur uti.</hi> Hor.</note> of it. The rich Miſer is not ſo properly ſaid to have his Eſtate, as his State poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and enſlaveth him; <hi>Habet nummos, non habet ipſum:</hi> We ſay, Fire and Water are bad Maſters; Gold and Silver are worſe, they ſink the Soul in deſtruction and perdition. The <hi>Miſer</hi> is the greateſt monſter in the World; no Creature in the Univerſe that only lives to it ſelf. The Sun communicates his light, the Springs are free of their waters to every thirſty Paſſenger: God's direction is to <hi>thee to drink the waters of thy own Ciſtern</hi> (to <note place="margin">Prov. 9. 15, 16.</note> take part of what he hath given thee thy ſelf) and that <hi>thy Fountain ſhould be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abroad,</hi> to the relief and benefit of others.

There is ſomewhat more neceſſary, which muſt be obſerved above lawful; <hi>e. g.</hi> To reſt on the Lord's day, and forbear work, lawful; but the ſanctifying the day is the neceſſary. To read a good Book, very lawful and commendable that day; but, if nothing hinder, to forbear coming to the Publick Worſhip, is ſinful and ſcandalous. So in many other caſes, Sacrifice ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beſt, ſometimes Mercy better: In the uſe of things lawful therefore the Apoſtle gives three good Cautions; 1. All <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12. &amp; 10. 23.</note> things are lawful (that is, things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not ſinful in their nature,) but all things are not expedient, profitable,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50777:73"/> convenient. Here I muſt have regard <hi>to my ſelf,</hi> ſaith learned <hi>Paraeus,</hi> how much, how far, how long expedient. 2. <hi>All things are lawful, but all things edifie not;</hi> though lawful to me, here I muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>my Neighbour.</hi> The third is, All <note place="margin">

               <p>14. There be many that will plead <note place="margin">Chriſtian liberty.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> and think that may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe many things, which ſavour rankly of unchriſtian Libertiniſm, rather then of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty. They can travell or work on the Lord's day, ſit up Night by Night at Cards and Dice, frequent Taverns and Plays day by day, drink Health after Health, go to Maſs, be preſent at Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, and cover all with the Veil of Chriſtian liberty, while they underſtand not well what Chriſtian liberty meaneth. It is a pretious and coſtly Jewel, purchaſed with the blood of Chriſt: And as all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

He that is called, being man's Servant, need not care for that, he is God's Free-man: So he that is called to be God's Free-man, needs to have a care, for he is ſtill God's Servant.

Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fair Excuſes all, but ſuch as they fairly excuſed themſelves out of Heaven by. Know, O Chriſtian, thou haſt <hi>two Callings</hi> to follow. Both muſt be looked after, or all is not well: Thou haſt two Hands, and God gives thee, as he did <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 15.</note> two Tables to hold: Thou muſt as well look to the firſt, as to the ſecond. Thy outward Calling is given to thee, as <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be an help to thy Spiritual Calling, and not as <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to be a ſnare. The <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 24.</note> outward Calling is to be ſubordinate to thy Spiritual, and ſo <hi>ſubordinata non pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as we ſay; they will not claſh. But as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> each ſtrengthen <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 16.</note> one anothers hands in the Lord. <hi>Let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with God:</hi> That is either an ill calling wherein thou canſt not abide with God, and God with thee, or ill managed. Take heed the lean Kine devour not the fat, and that the great Husband do not devour the good Chriſtian: There are ſtore of great Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Huſwives in Hell; but ſuch as ſerved Mammon more then God; ſlight in God's Service, ſerious in the Worlds: <hi>Shimei</hi> looking after his Servants, loſt his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50777:75"/> life; take heed in looking after thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the World, thou looſe not thy Soul. The good Servant knows how to <hi>take his Work, and leave it,</hi> (as we ſay) that is, ſo to time and place every thing, that nothing be loſt by negligence and careleſneſs; but every thing in the fitteſt time and place. And he is the good Chriſtian that knows how to take the <hi>work of his calling and leave it,</hi> that all things may be ſo contrived and fore-caſt, that one buſineſs do not enterfere with another, to the prejudice of either. Now tell me, thou that haſt a great Trade, &amp; art full of buſineſs; thou canſt contrive it ſo as to have a Dining-time, and canſt thou not find a praying-time? Thou wilt ſpare time to ſpeak with a Cuſtomer, and haſt thou no time to ſpeak with thy God? Thou wilt be ſure to take time by day or night to over-look thy Shop-Book, and haſt thou no time to look into thy Soul-Book, thy Bible, or thy Book of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? It is alwayes ominous when <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> part; when a great Trade or Stock draws thee from God, and the ſociety of his People: He never did thrive after. And remember, that all theſe Self-Excuſers in the Text are rejected, the Lord ſaying, <hi>None of theſe ſhall taſte of my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>

                  </note> Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, which is indeed of that altitude and depth, that, as thoſe waters in the Sanctuary, there is no wading through, or paſſing over them, without that Reaſon-ſilencing, and abrupt admiration of the Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Oh the amazing Depth, and riches of the <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! yet how do many argue from this Doctrine: If I am elected, I am ſafe, though I do nothing; Election will take his effect, and I ſhall obtain. On the other ſide, if reprobated, all endeavours are of no effect; for God's Decrees cannot be fruſtrated, I ſhall unavoidably periſh. But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50777:78"/> I Anſwer, Who taught thus to reaſon? Thy buſineſs is not to pry into God's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, but attend his revealed, and thy own duty: <hi>Secret things belong to God, things revealed to us,</hi> Deut. 29. 29. And firſt, For Election, know, there is no ſuch abſolute Election, as to be excluſive of the means, but doth include and imply all the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatio ad finem includit media non poteſt hunc ſperare qui negligit iſta.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</note> wayes and means preparing for glory, as effectual Calling, Faith, Repentance, holy Obedience. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in Love.</hi> So 2 Theſſ. 2. 13. <hi>God hath choſen you to Salvation, through Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth.</hi> As there is no ſuch abſolute Promiſe of Harveſt and Fruitfulneſs, excluſive of man's induſtry and endeavours in ploughing and ſowing, but the means are included in ſubordination to the end.</p>
               <p>2. And as for <hi>Reprobation</hi> (not to wade <note place="margin">Deus ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans ad paenas propter peccata non eſt magis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtus quam cum paenas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligit prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peccata. Paraeus.</note> into the Controverſie:) It will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be as juſt in God to decree to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men for Sin, as to inflict the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Sin is committed: As it is the ſame juſtice in the Magiſtrate to Enact ſuch a Penalty for ſuch an Offence, as to execute it after the Offence committed. God puniſheth none but for Sin, nor doth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50777:78"/> decree to puniſh any, but ſuch in whom he findeth Sin unrepented of. 2. As for thy Reprobation, look not into this Abyſs, neither caſt thy ſelf from this Pinacle: But ſtudy thy duty, which is to work out thy Salvation with fear and trembling. 3. Be aſſured, no man can know himſelf, or any other, to be a Reprobate, (though ſome may have aſſurance of their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;) Becauſe, 1. God can call and change the heart of the moſt wicked man at the laſt hour. 2. All God's Elect were ſometimes Children of wrath as well as others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. 3. And ſome of God's own Children have fallen ſometimes into moſt foul ſins, and ſometimes layen long in ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. 4. Therefore it is not God's ſecret Decree thou ſhouldſt ſo much fear and ſtartle at, as thy own Sin and Diſobedience, which is that which prepares the Veſſels of wrath to their deſtruction. As <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 13.</note> to ſay, There is a fatall Decree, that my Kingdom ſhall be rent from me, therefore all is one what courſe I take, or whoſe counſel I follow; but he ſhould have hearkened to the Counſel of thoſe ancient men, and truſted God with his Crown. Nor could <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſay, There is a fatall Doom on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it ſhall be ſacked,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50777:79"/> and burnt to aſhes: But he ſhould have hearkened to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who beſought him to <note place="margin">Jer. 38. 20, 23.</note> yield to the <hi>Caldean,</hi> aſſuring him, then all ſhould be ſafe: Otherwiſe, ſaith he, (not God's Decree, or Sentence, denounced, but) thou will ſet <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on fire.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Doctrine abuſed, is, That <hi>all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct. 2. <hi>That all are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>are Sinners,</hi> and there is none Righteous, no not one. Both branches are true; the firſt is affirmed 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. The other <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 10. But what then? therefore ſayſt thou, I may do well enough, though a vile Sinner, and be ſaved, though not ſo righteous and religious as ſome ſeem to be. But mark, there is a great difference between <hi>Sin and Sin:</hi> All indeed are guilty of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, and all of years of Actual; But all are not Sinners alike, ſome are obſtinate, wilful, preſumptuous, deſperate Sinners, that make a mock of Sin, a trade of Sin; <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 9. Prov. 4. 17.</note> It is their Meat and Drink. Others are humbled, trembling, penitent, mourning, reforming, believing, ſelf-abhorring Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who watch, pray, reſiſt Sin, ſhun the occaſions of it. What is this to thee, who goeſt on in ſin? Their's are Gnats, thine Camels: Their's Moats, thine Beams. There are certain Sins, one may call them, the ſpots of God's people, and have not excluded them Salvation. As firſt, 1. It

                  <hi>we are juſtified and ſaved by Faith</hi> alone, which is moſt true and conſonant to Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. I will therefore believe, ſaith the careleſs Chriſtian, and then hope I ſhall do well enough, though I have no good works, which I hear are excluded in thoſe fore-cited Scriptures, in the matter of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: But know, O vain man, That Faith and Works are only oppoſed in the matter of Juſtification, but are never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and parted. As the Eye and Ear are oppoſed in the matter of ſeeing; the Eye only ſees, not the Ear; but where God gives Eyes, he gives Ears alſo: So to whom Grace is given to believe, it is given
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50777:82"/> to obey. Faith is not an idle, but active and operative Grace; <hi>It works by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. Is of a heart purifying nature, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. It unites the Soul to Chriſt, ſo that Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to dwell in the Soul by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 16. And to live in the Soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. The right Epithete of true Faith, is <hi>moſt holy Faith,</hi> Jude, verſe 20. His right property, is <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> Acts 26. 28.

                  </note> goes a great way with many, and themſelves will make the uſe to excuſe their Enormities. Every one, the very beſt, have their failings, none is perfect; all the Saints had their Imperfections. But thou mayſt read much of their Perfections alſo, if thou haſt a mind to it; <hi>Noah, Abraham, Job, Aſa,</hi> and many others were perfect, the Scripture witneſſeth. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, All true Chriſtians muſt endeavour after it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. It is commended, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 48. Exhorted too, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. Prayed for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 8. 10. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinguiſh of Perfection; 1. There was an Original Perfection, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. God made man perfect: This was, but is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50777:83"/> not. 2. There will be a future perfection, when we ſhall come to be among the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the juſt made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. This is not, but ſhall be. 3. There is a legal Perfection, ſuch as the Law requires: This was in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. But is not to be found in any ſince the Fall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. 4. There is an imaginary Perfection (ſelf-reputed) ſuch was in <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ezek. 27. 3. &amp; 28. 12. 15. And in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3. Of this there is too much. But 5. There is an Evangelical Perfection; and this is that which we ſhould ſeek after. And this is 1. Imputative, as there is an imputed Righteouſneſs, whereby Believers are made perfect by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14. Thy Beauty was perfect, through my Comelineſs which I had put upon thee: This is our beſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and properly ſo called; thus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is perfect, ſhall be as his Maſter and Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 40. By this <hi>Job,</hi> and other godly perſons, were reputed perfect, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. 2. There is a Comparative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; Thus <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his Generations, thou he had no abſolute perfection; yet compare him with other men, he might go for a perfect man: He did ſo out-ſhine them, as the Stars compared with the Sun are no Lights at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50777:83"/> all, but compared with the other parts of Heaven, and much more with the clods of the Earth are glorious Lights. 3. There is a perfection of parts (an Inchoative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) which is yet incomplete, but in a way to a complete perfection, and ſhall come to be perfected, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12, 13. 4. As there is a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parts, ſo of Hearts, which next to that imputed is our beſt, and we may take greateſt comfort in, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. Thus was <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> perfect, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. 5. There is a perfection of way, that wherein the godly ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to walk; though ſometimes they ſlack their pace, and walk not ſo evenly in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 101. 2. 6. 6. There is a Perfection of Deſires and Endeavours, a reſtleſs purſuit of perfection, forgetting what is behind, and preſſing forward to the mark, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13. And herein ſtands the beſt of our perfection here below. Now to apply this to thee, who pleadeſt the Saints Imperfections, to juſtifie thy ſinful and lazy courſes. See here are many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and thou haſt never a one of them (unleſs the <hi>Laodicean</hi> ſelf-conceited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) therefore no Saint ſure. Excuſe not thy ſelf by their Imperfections any
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50777:84"/> more, except thou doſt ſtrive to out-go them, at leaſt to equal them.</p>
               <p>7. Another Doctrine grounded on the <note place="margin">Doct. 7. <hi>We are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                  </note> Scripture, Rom. 6. 14. <hi>That we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but under Grace;</hi> is much abuſed: If not under the Law, ſaith the Libertine, why ſhould I trouble my ſelf to keep it, or be troubled if I break it? Underſtand therefore what that means, we are not under the Law: 1. It is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Believers, and ſuch as are true Converts, that they are not under the Law, that is, the <hi>irritation</hi> of the Law, ſo as to be more <hi>irritated</hi> and incited by the curb and reſtraint which the Law lays upon us not to luſt, to luſt the rather; as we are apt to deſire what is forbidden, as the Apoſtle is ſuppoſed to ſpeak of himſelf while unregenerate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 8. But we <hi>are under Grace,</hi> which checketh and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that rebellious inclination, and the irritation of the Law. 2. That we are not under the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. but under Grace, which hath tranſlated the Curſe from us to Chriſt, who was <hi>made a Curſe for us.</hi> 3. Nor under the <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the Law (as well as the Curſe or Condemnation) as ſometimes <hi>Adam</hi> was before his Fall, who was to look for his juſtification and acceptance, from his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50777:84"/> of the Law, he being then under the Covenant of Works (the Covenant of Grace not being ſpoken of till after the Fall.) In which reſpect Believers are now ſaid to be <hi>dead to the Law,</hi> that they might <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> live unto God. 4. Nor are Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the rigor</hi> of the Law, ſo as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19.</note> ſtand right in God's ſight, if they come not up to the ſtrict terms of the Law (when through infirmity they fail) but we are under a more eaſie Yoke, Grace doth mitigate and diſpenſe with the <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> the rigor and ſeverity of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. 5. Nor are Believers under the <hi>Coaction</hi> of the Law; the Law is not made for the Righteous in this ſenſe, ſo as either to condemn, or compel him; but he is under Grace, which prompts and puts him on, out of a ſpirit of love, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind to a chearful Obedience. But becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> would you make the Law and Grace to jar? And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace and Practice of Sin to agree. The Apoſtle bids defiance to ſuch an impious Inference, and, in a ſort, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to give an Anſwer to this Objection; <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14, 15.</note> but with abhorrence crys out, <hi>God forbid.</hi> And elſewhere poſitively affirmeth, That he never intended his Doctrine of Grace

No, neither, becauſe I dare not Judge him: What then ſhall I ſay? O Brother, if thou wilt be free from doubting, repent whiles thou art in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50777:86"/> health. If thou wilt repent when thou canſt not ſin, thy ſins have left thee, and not thou thy Sins. In another place again, it is not to be ſaid how many this vain hope of <hi>late Repentance</hi> hath deceived and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Again, ſaith he, I have read the Scripture over and over, and I find not ſo much as one in the ſpace of two thouſand years ſaved by his Repentance at his end, except the Thief on the Croſs. To St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I ſhall joyn a remarkable paſſage, or two of the learned Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who Preaching at Court of Repentance, fell to diſcourſe of late Repentance and ſeeking God, and hath theſe words, That that may be ſaid about this, is this, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſome one or two of a thouſand, or ten thouſands have; how then? ſhall not we therefore ſeek God before? Again, this time is the time when all Hypocrites, Atheiſts, Tag and Rag come in to ſeek him in a ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall not we be confounded to ſee our ſelves in their number? Again, what is our ſeeking then? Is it not to lie ſtill in our Beds, and ſuffer a few words to be ſpoken in our Ears, and have a little Opiate Divinity miniſtred to our Souls, and ſo ſent away? and much more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To theſe two ſo eminent Perſons, I may add a third of Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> (St.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50777:87"/> 
                  <hi>Greenham</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſomewhere calls him) my Sentence is, ſaith that judicious Divine, that a man now lying at the point of death, having the fears and terrors of death now upon him, in that ſtate of fear and pain, may have a ſorrow for his life paſt; but becauſe the weakneſs of the Fleſh and the bitterneſs of Death doth moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly procure it, we ought to ſuſpect, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is no Promiſe, I ſaid, that ſuch Repentance ſhall be accepted; But I know what will be Replyed, Though I have no Promiſe, I have an Example, The <hi>Thief on the Croſs:</hi> And why may not I as well as he? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This Example, as ſome other paſſages of Scripture concerning the falls and miſcarriage of the Saints, is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many, and is like ſome of thoſe Scriptures which the unlearned and inconſiderate perſons do wreſt to their own deſtruction. But 1. Conſider there is but one ſuch Example in all the Bible, and this related but once, and by one only of the Evangeliſts (all four mentioning the dying of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Theeves) only St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſets <note place="margin">Luke 23. 40.</note> down this paſſage, the reſt being ſilent: The Holy Ghoſt eaſily foreſaw how apt we are to ſurfeit, even of a little of this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50777:87"/> Honey: One, we ſay, that none might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; But one, leaſt any ſhould preſume. 2. Conſider at the ſame time you have an Example of another that died without Repentance; therefore I may with much more reaſon retort this Argument. The one Thief did not, nay could not repent; for God gave him not Repentance, but as he caſt off God in his life, God caſt him off at death: As he lived, he dyed, reviling, curſing, deriding, deſparing; thou haſt therefore more cauſe to fear to be left with the one, then to hope to be taken with the other. There was then a Concurrence of a many the moſt ſtupendious Prodigies that the World ever beheld, the Sun at Noon-day looſing his light, the Air darkened, the Earth quaking, the Rocks rent, the Sun of God crying out <hi>Eloi, Eloi, &amp;c.</hi> his fellow Thief now recanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of an old Malefactor, and late ſcoffing Blaſphemer, while upon the Croſs, of a ſudden a Penitent, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, a Believer, a Confeſſor, a Preacher, a Prayer, preaching to him Repentance, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Saviour for forgiveneſs; yet all this wrought not upon him: The hard Rocks rent and cleft, but his more then rocky heart rent not; His Bones, Arms and Legs, were broken, his heart unbroken. We may as well almoſt expect a ſecond <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:50777:88"/> of Chriſt, ſaid one, as a <hi>ſecond Thief;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dike.</hi>
                  </note> nay, I may ſay, if there could be a ſecond Crucifying, there might alſo be found a <hi>ſecond Impenitent</hi> Thief. Some man (ſaid that great <hi>Andrews)</hi> going a Journey, hath found a Purſe of money by the way; were it not madneſs, in hope of like hap to us to leave our money behind us? hear Mr. <hi>Greenbam</hi> again: Beſides this one, there is not one more in all the Bible; and for this one that ſped, a thouſand thouſands have miſſed; and what folly is it to put our ſelves in a way, where ſo many have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried: It is as if one ſhould ſpur his Aſſe till he ſpake, becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſſe did once ſpeak; ſo groſly doth Satan abuſe us, and our own folly blind us.</p>

Is godlineſs the <hi>great gain and contentment,</hi> ſay they? we can find neither the one nor the other: True, if we call Riches, Honour, Preferments, the great gain, and contentment to conſiſt in a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, Epicurean ſatisfying the Fleſh: Theſe the godly count but petty gains, and little contentment in them. But his gains are Pardon of Sin, Intereſt in Chriſt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, Riches of Grace, Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a Title to, and Aſſurance of, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Crown: Theſe are with him the true and great Gain, and the matter of his Contentment; which is no where to be found, but in the Courts of Godlineſs; not in the Courts of Princes, or Palaces of Prelates.

The Heathens would hit the Chriſtians in the Teeth with this, You Chriſtians worſhip but one God, and can't agree; we worſhip many, and yet agree. It is to be confeſſed, and ſadly bewailed, that there are too many

What a learned Divine ſaid in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> It is <note place="margin">Dr. Potter.</note> a great vanity to hope, or expect, that all learned men in this life ſhould abſolutely conſent in all the pieces and particles of Divine Truth. The light whereby we ſee in this ſtate of mortality, is feeble and very different, in regard of the good ſpirits illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the capacities of men, their diligence in Study, Prayer, and other means of Knowledge. There were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Apoſtles times; In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one ſaying, <hi>I am of</hi>

Beſides, there is a <hi>German</hi> Doctor, who hath collected out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf Two hundred thirty ſeven Contradictions, and ſet them down in his own words, as my Authour tells me. There are differences among us, but not about the great and weighty Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are in Scripture laid down plainly and clearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Circumſtantials, and matters of more Intricacy and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; where yet an unity of Faith and Love may be maintained, under a diverſity of Opinion; yet are all agreed againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the one hand, and Prophaneneſs on the other. There is difference of Opinion among Phyſicians, yet all agree an Hectick is no good Conſtitution, a Pluriſie, Feavor, Conſumption, are dangerous Diſeaſes, and not to be ſlighted: Difference among Lawyers, yet all agree Treaſon, Felony, Murder, are Capital Crimes. So difference among this and that Party, but all agree in condemning Popery as Idolatrous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Ignorance, and contempt of God

Think not therefore want of Book-learning may excuſe thee from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Duties of Chriſtianity.

The third ſaid, I have married a Wife, and muſt conſummate the Marriage, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come.</hi> None ſaid, I will not; yet is their ſlighting recorded, and all three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. No Employment, no change of Condition, can priviledge from attending God's Service: One thing is neceſſary ſtands alwayes indiſpenſably true; the other might be done, this muſt not be left undone. There was a Diſpenſation in the <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 5.</note> old Law, That if a man had new married a wife, he ſhould not be preſſed to war that year; but no Diſpenſation for omitting the Service of God for one day. The King by his Place, and by reaſon of the weighty Affairs incumbent on his Office, be thought fit to be priviledged above any others (as being Superior to all, and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior only to God;) yet <hi>muſt</hi> is for the King, and <hi>ſhall</hi> from his Superior: He was commanded by God, that when he ſate <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 18, 19.</note> upon the Throne, he <hi>ſhall write</hi> him a Copy
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50777:96"/> of the Law, and it <hi>ſhall be</hi> with him, and he <hi>ſhall read</hi> therein all the dayes of his life, &amp;c. Thus did holy <hi>David,</hi> who made it his meditation continually, and by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Pſal. 119, 97, 99.</note> ſo continually verſed therein, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wiſer then his Teachers: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his many private Devotions, the Pſalms, Hymns and Prayers of his own compoſing, he was a conſtant Student in God's Word. We read of that Renowned Succeſſor of his, <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that he took the <note place="margin">2 Kings 23. 2.</note> Book of the Law, and <hi>himſelf read it</hi> to all his People. <hi>Luther</hi> tells of that pious and valiant Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that he had ſix of his Gentlemen who attended him, read daily to him ſix hours out of the holy Scripture. And never to be forgotten is the practiſe of one of the Kings of this Nation, King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who divided the four and twenty hours of the natural day into three parts, allowing himſelf eight hours for his bodily refreſhment by Sleep, Food and Recreation; a ſecond eight hours he ſpent in Reading, Praying and Writing; and the third eight he ſpent in attending Affairs of State, hearing Cauſes, &amp;c.

                  <hi>the time to build the houſe of the Lord.</hi> So generally when we call upon men to repent, and amend their lives, they put us off, and ſay, It is a good work, and muſt be thought upon, and they will wait for a good hour to do it in.

                  </note> ſaying they will not repent, but many for ſaying they will, but not yet. This was the Sluggard's Plea, Yet a little more ſleep, <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 11.

                  </note> And as I ſaid of the former, if thou couldſt make this out, thou mighteſt be excuſed. But ſo it is not, nor can be, if thou wilt not wilfully caſt away thy ſelf, holding faſt thy ſin, and forſaking thy own mercy, <note place="margin">Tonah 2. 8.</note> refuſing to come to Chriſt, who is able and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50777:101"/> ready to ſave to the utmoſt all that come <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> to God for mercy through him: Yet was this the lazy Servants excuſe, I preſumed thee to be a hard Maſter, I might ſow and <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 24.</note> not reap, uſe my Indeavours, yet loſe my labour; I therefore feared, and hid my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I may ſay to ſuch, as Chriſt to the Phariſees, Full well ye reject the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, to hold faſt your own Traditions; So do theſe reject the Grace of God, to ſtick faſt to their own Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. But theſe take the ready to make ſure their own Condemnation in a moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational way. When was it ever known that any Malefactor, deſirous to preſerve his life, would ſtand mute? or wilfully caſt away himſelf by flying out againſt the Law or Judge? But will make his plea to obtain favour, caſt himſelf upon God and his Country, and ſue and intreat that he may have the benefit of any clauſe in the Law, or former Preſidents in like caſe, and ſo he comes of ſafe. But theſe, as it were, in contempt of God's mercy <hi>ſtand mute,</hi> will not plead, nor pray the benefit of the Law (the Goſpel of Chriſt I mean) nor deſire they may have the ſame favour that <hi>former Preſidents</hi> have had, the greateſt Offenders pardoned upon ſubmiſſion; but wilfully caſt away themſelves, as if God, the Father
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50777:102"/> of Mercies, were inexorable, and their Condemnation peremptorily, and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably determined. Thus ſometimes have ſome right godly Chriſtians behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under their ſpiritual diſtreſs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extreme melancholy, dreadful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Satan, and ſad deſertion for a time, &amp;c. concluding there was no hope, when yet all was ſafe. Famous is the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mrs. <hi>Anne Honywood,</hi> who was in that diſtreſs of Spirit, and ſo poſſeſſed with an immoveable perſwaſion of her eternal Damnation, that ſhe ſaid to a worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter who was with her, endeavouring to comfort her, That it was no more poſſible for her to eſcape damnation, then for that Venice-Glaſs, which ſhe had then in her hand, not to be broken, if it fell to the ground; ſhe let it fall, it rebounded to the Wall, and was taken up whole. The Lord might have left her in her ſad miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, but to confirm her, and warn others by her example, was pleaſed, in that miraculous manner, to confute her fears. Somewhat like to this is the ſtory of Mrs. <hi>Katherine Bretterg,</hi> a pious Gentlewoman, who for ſome time was under ſuch diſtreſs, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In the lives of Mr.</hi> S. C. I I. Part.</note> doubting of her Salvation, that ſhe often wiſht, She had never been born, or, that ſhe been any other Creature then a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50777:102"/> Woman, crying out often, <hi>Woe is me</hi> a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, woful, forſaken Creature, with abundance of Tears: She ſometimes durſt not pray, but ſaid, I may not pray, I may not pray; but it pleaſed God at laſt not only to bring her out of her fears and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but to give her ſtrong aſſurance of her Salvation, that ſhe dyed in much peace, and full of Joys unſpeakable and glorious. I may add to theſe two (to ſpare more inſtances in this kind) the example of Mr. <hi>John Glover,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Martyrology ſpeaks, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he <hi>had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and was in that Diſtreſs for five years, that had he been in Hell he could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired more; he was ſo macerated and worn away, that he neither in that time took quiet reſt, nor could brook Meat or Drink, or any outward comfort: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this was delivered, and ſuch a frame of holineſs and meaſure of comfort was wrought in him, that he ſeemed to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a celeſtial life. This may call to our minds that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be ſcarcely ſaved, where ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50777:103"/> Doctrines backed with a more ſtrange Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; 1. That not one here and there, but <hi>all are ſhut up in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe of all Chriſtians (one time or other) to be ſhut up in this Dungeon. This poor tempred Creatures think ſtrange; the next is ſtranger. 2. That <hi>God ſhuts them up</hi> in unbelief; God is their Keeper all this while, and not Satan, as they are apt to conclude: God ſhuts them up, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did <hi>Simeon,</hi> for their Humiliation and Tryal: Unbelief is God's Priſon (I may ſay in this ſenſe) Preſumption is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. 3. The reaſon is <hi>ſtrangeſt</hi> of all, That he may <hi>have mercy upon all</hi> ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> That they may ſee their need of Mercy, fly to it, caſt themſelves upon it; as did holy Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> dying, cry, Mercy, mercy is all I want; and God may have the whole glory of it, and they may the more admire the Wiſdom of God in this diſpenſation, when he ſhall enlarge them; as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren did, when he ſpake no more roughly to them as formerly, but declared his relation to them, and teſtified his brotherly love. But all this while, there is no place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair to all ſuch as wait upon God, and rely on his mercy.</p>
               <p>The laſt excuſe I ſhall mention in this kind, is, of ſome whoſe meaning is better
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50777:103"/> then their underſtanding, an <hi>exceſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exceſs of humility.</note> who, when invited, hold off from their duty by a voluntary (but no wayes commendable) humility. Thus did the Centurion excuſe himſelf from a receiving of Chriſt, I am <hi>not worthy</hi> thou ſhouldſt come <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 8.</note> under my Roof. This is the caſe of many a gracious Soul, who, by reaſon of ſome ſcruples, keep off from receiving Chriſt in his Sacrament, when thou art the perſon Chriſt calls; <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come</hi>

                  <hi>to the Waters, buy Wine and Milk without money, and without price:</hi> Thou thinkeſt thy money, preparation, and price of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity would make thee more welcome, but it is not ſo. Thou ſayeſt, I dare not come, I have not the purification of the Sanctuary; I ſhall eat and drink my dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if I eat unworthily. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is a <hi>legal</hi> worthineſs, this thou canſt not have, and an <hi>Evangelical</hi> worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which may conſiſt with the legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.

                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 15.</note> (the more aſhamed, the better ſanctified; and the more ſanctified, the more aſhamed ever) and came with this Prayer, <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord, though he be not</hi>

Who, when the Lord promiſed to furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs with Fleſh and Foul for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a moneth together, had his Faith ſtaggered, and did upon the matter ſay, Lord excuſe me, <hi>How can this be?</hi> A <hi>moneth</hi> is a great while, and <hi>Six hundred thouſand</hi> are a great many mouths; I knew thee to be Almighty, and were it for a Meal, I could eaſily perſwade my ſelf to believe it; or if it were for a moneths-board of a few thouſands; but Lord they are Six hundred thouſand men, beſides as many more Women and Children. Why <hi>Moſes,</hi> Is the Lord's hand ſhortned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is marvelous in thy Eyes, is it ſo alſo in mine? <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 6. Alas, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we in our outward ſtraits diſtruſt and limit God: I have ſuch a great charge, and ſmall means, a little Oyl and Meal in the Veſſel to take to; <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> And in reſpect of our ſpiritual eſtate, we are as apt to limit God's Mercy, as others his Power in reſpect of their outward ſtate. He can forgive the hundred Pence; but can he, will he forgive the ten thouſand Talents?

But take thou heed of this Reply, I am not worthy, therefore can except no more at God's hands then I deſerve.

               <p>There are <hi>four kinds of Falls,</hi> which may befal the Child of God, each worſe then other: The firſt and lighteſt is, that in our daily combate, by reaſon of the ſin that dwells in them, they do what <hi>they would</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>not,</hi> and <hi>cannot do what they would</hi> but daily fall ſhort; In which reſpect we are none of <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> us <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> but <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> and <hi>Relapſarians</hi> too: This is but like the fall of a <hi>miſt</hi> in Winter, the Sun breaks out, and a fair day follows.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. When a good man is overtaken with ſome more notable miſcarriage, as were they who diſſembled in the buſineſs of Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, reſtore. This is as a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50777:113"/> fall whereby a Leg is put out of joynt; yet ſet again, and all is well. Let him that is free from theſe two, take a Ladder, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> ſaid <hi>to Aceſius</hi> the <hi>Novatian,</hi> and go <note place="margin">

               <p>The third is more ſad, when a Believer falls into ſome <hi>fouler ſin,</hi> as did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> into ſins waſting Conſcience. This like the fall of <hi>Eutichus</hi> from the third loft, dead for the preſent, but after recovered by a Miracle of Mercy.</p>
               <p>The fourth is a kind of <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible decay, an abatement or loſs of <hi>firſt love,</hi> and may be never comes to former ſtrength and livelineſs, or to regain their former peace. Thus, as <hi>David</hi> in his age grew cold, and needed an <hi>Abiſhag</hi> to lie in <note place="margin">1 Kings 1. 3.</note> his Boſome, his natural heat being abated: So his Sons ſpiritual heat abated, by reaſon of the <hi>many Abiſhags</hi> that lay in his boſome; and though he was beloved of his God, yet did his Sun ſet in a Cloud: This like the fall of <hi>the hair</hi> in old age, waxeth thinner and thinner; though life remains, nature is not ſo ſtrong and vigorous as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>But there are <hi>four worſe</hi> kinds of falls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to wicked men: The <hi>firſt</hi> proves <hi>final,</hi> but is not total at firſt, but <hi>ſenſim</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50777:113"/> 
                  <hi>ſine ſenſu,</hi> by little and little; Thus the <hi>thorny ground</hi> miſcarried: This like <hi>Elie</hi>'s <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>fall</hi> backward, to the breaking of his Neck.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, Is a <hi>total and final,</hi> but not <hi>voluntary</hi> at firſt, but are beaten out of heart, as the <hi>ſtony ground</hi> by tribulation ariſing: This like the fall of <hi>Siſera,</hi> he fell down <note place="margin">Jud. 5. 27.</note> dead, with his nail ſticking in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>The third, A more fearful, a <hi>total, final, voluntary</hi> and <hi>deliberate;</hi> yet not malitious fall: Thus <hi>Demas</hi> is ſuppoſed to fall, who of a Diſciple, or Teacher formerly, is ſaid afterwards to have become a Prieſt in an Idol-Temple at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> (ſo <hi>Dorotheus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſther 6. 13.</note> Reports.) This fall is like the fall of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> when they thus begin to fall, no hopes of Recovery.</p>
               <p>4. Yet is there a worſe; The <hi>fourth</hi> is as the opening of the <hi>fourth Seal,</hi> where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 8.</note> the <hi>pale Horſe, and Death</hi> upon his back, and Hell following, <hi>a total, final, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, deliberate and malitious</hi> falling away: Such was the fall of <hi>Simon Magus, Hymenaeus, Alexander, Julian, &amp;c.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a fall the Gulph is fixed, the Decree gone out, <hi>Nulla retrorſum,</hi> no renewing ſuch to Repentance.

               <p>4.

               <p>THus have I wearied the Reader, and my ſelf too, in ſeeking to hunt out this ſubtile Soul-Deceiver out of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſuges and Lurking-holes.

                  <hi>they come,</hi> it will lead us back as far as <hi>Original</hi> Sin; there, then, thence they had their Original: They came in with the firſt Sin. As Satan was a Deſtroyer and

The Devil firſt put into <hi>Judas</hi> heart to betray his Maſter, then taught him to wipe his mouth, and ſay, <hi>Is it I?</hi> He firſt taught <hi>Ananias</hi> to tempt the Holy Ghoſt, then puts <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> a lye in his mouth to excuſe it.

                  <hi>Woe to the World becauſe of Offences,</hi> was <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 7.</note> once ſaid: And woe to the World becauſe <hi>of Excuſes.</hi> They are the ſin of the World, of the Church, of all, of every one. When we are called off from ſin, we make Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; when to confeſs ſin, Excuſes; when to Duty, we put off with Excuſes; when to believe, we make Excuſes; when the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Grace is tendred, we make all void by Excuſes. Nothing but Excuſes, Excuſes, none ſo young, ſo ignorant, but is skilled in them; none ſo poor, but is ſtored with them; none ſo good, but one time or other hath had one; none ſo bad but hath many of them.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:50777:128"/>
               <p> I have named an hundred in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and another may come after and find an hundred more, and yet leave glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to them that come after us both: few good Excuſes, but ſtore of bad from ſelf, others, God, Satan, any thing, every thing. Let us take a ſhort Survey.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we are called to <hi>avoid ſin,</hi> or <hi>break it off;</hi> how do we ſhrug and ſhrink? When the Lord cryes out to <hi>Lot, Haſt thou, eſcape for thy life, linger not;</hi> how do we cry loath to depart, as the Sluggard out of his Bed. When the Lord calls as <hi>Jonathan</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 38.</note> to his Lad, <hi>make ſpeed, haſt, ſtay not; Cito, longe, tarde,</hi> as we ſay of the Peſtilence, we invert it, and ſay, <hi>Tarde, prope, cito;</hi> we ſhould fly from Sin ſpeedily, fly far off from it, return ſlowly or never. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſlowly, loath to part with it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> with <hi>Benjamin:</hi> Cry out for it, as <hi>Micah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 18. 14.</note> for his gods; go along as far as we can, or dare, as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> did to <hi>Michal</hi> his wife (from whom he was to be divorced) and <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 15.</note> can't part without tears; and in ſtead of <hi>going far,</hi> we do as <hi>Hagar,</hi> ſit down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a <hi>bow ſhoot,</hi> loath to ſee ſin die, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 16.</note> to it again as ſoon; what means this bleating elſe? Oh not ſo my Lord; Is it not a little one, a venial ſin? If I never do worſe, I hope I may do well enough; I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50777:129"/> have taſted but a little of this Honey, and muſt I die for it? Have not others done as bad, or worſe, and yet done well? I have Examples, multitude, great ones, ſome that go for good men, my Leaders; I hope my place, calling, quality, profeſſion, common cuſtom may excuſe me; beſide, I live civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceably, and do what the Law will bear me out in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, when men are dealt with <hi>to confeſs and acknowledge</hi> their ſin, what ado is here, how long was <hi>Samuel</hi> ere he could get <hi>Saul</hi> ſpeak that hard and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing word <hi>Peccavi?</hi> how many ſhifts and evaſions firſt? I have done my duty as far as I thought my ſelf bound, I am not in fault at all; we ſometimes deny the fact as <hi>Gehazi,</hi> ſometimes extenuate it. It was my ignorance, ſaith one; It is my nature, another; an ill cuſtom I have got, a third, I was not my ſelf: A fourth, I was in drink, in paſſion, in haſt, anger, or in fear: Or but in jeſt, ſay others, my zeal, good meaning: Conſcience muſt excuſe me, ſay others, I had paſſed my word, made a Vow, bound my ſelf under an Oath and Curſe, and what would you have me do? my Credit and Honour lay at ſtake, my Shame was prevented, Profit advanced, my Calling followed, ſuch benefit to my
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50777:129"/> ſelf or friend procured: Beſides, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not ſo great, and was but once, nor had I any ill intention in the earth; I ſhould have been ſingular, and I know not what, if I had done otherwiſe, and made ſcruple. I am civil, painful, peaceable, pay every one his own; and if I never do worſe, I make no queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we can't but yield it to be a ſin, then have we other Excuſes, <hi>Let others look to it,</hi> I am faultleſs; it was their doings, not mine; I was a Child, and muſt do what my Father bad me; a Servant, and muſt keep my Maſters Secrets, and do his Commands; I had my dependance on my Superiors, and muſt comply with their will; I had Commands to encourage me, Promiſes to allure, Threats to terrifie me, Examples to draw me, Friends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to importune me, how could I refuſe? Beſides, what ſome ſcrupulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, more preciſe then wiſe, make ſuch a matter of, is the cuſtom of the Time, Place, Country and Company that I converſe with. God help if ſo few as ſome men ſay ſhould be ſaved, and the way to Heaven ſhould be ſo narrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we are preſſed <hi>to repent of Sin,</hi> and forſake it, how do we ſtill Conſcience, and juſtifie our ſelves. Are we not all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50777:130"/> Sinners? have not the beſt their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? There is no perfection in this life; ſometimes we caſt it upon Satan, he dogged me; ſometimes upon God, he denied me the Grace, gave me not his Spirit, or ought me a ſhame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When called upon to more <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and amendment of life, we are ready to plead God's great Mercy, gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Chriſt's Merits, the Doctrines of free Grace, juſtification by Faith, remiſſion of Sins, imputed Righteouſneſs, and our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Repentance hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When excited to <hi>holineſs,</hi> we plead the diſrepute Holineſs is in, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences we may meet with, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions caſt upon the Godly, the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tryals they meet with, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the way of Salvation, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Lives of ſome Preachers, the foul Miſcarriages of ſome Profeſſors; and one great Obſervation above all the reſt, the quiet and peaceable end that ſome great Sinners have made.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When we are warned to take heed of <hi>ſecurity</hi> and ſlothfulneſs, ſome are ready to plead God's unchangeable Decrees; they who are elected ſhall be ſaved, endeavours are to no purpoſe; all our Works cannot merit: If not elected, it is in vain to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50777:130"/> ſtrive againſt the ſtream, Faith, Repentance, and Obedience will come to nothing; God giveth Grace and Salvation where he pleaſeth, and none elſe can have it. Theſe are the Excuſes about Sin.</p>
               <p>2. In the next place, when we are call'd upon <hi>to duty,</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Speak Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>thy Servant heareth,</hi> as Samuel; or <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> with <hi>Paul.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 9. 6.</note> How many put-offs? I have put off my <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 3.</note> Coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have much indiſpoſition at preſent. It is unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, mid-night, come again ſome other time, trouble me not now, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 7. Or if we yield at any time, it is with no good will, as the unjuſt Judge (not out of fear of God, or regard to man) relieved the Widow, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rid of her; ſo do ſome perform Duty, not out of love to God, or Duty, but to be rid of the clamours and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity of Conſcience, and to be more at eaſe and quiet. Good God! what a world of Excuſes have the Sons of men deviſed to ſhift off thy holy Commands! Some have confeſſed the Duty is good, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand juſt; but I muſt be excuſed, I am a Child, I have no competency of parts, my inſufficiency may excuſe me. Others cry out, What a wearineſs it is! what ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, difficulty, unpleaſantneſs is in the way
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50777:131"/> to Heaven! my Ignorance, want of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unaccuſtomedneſs to ſuch courſes may excuſe me; others again, I am for it, like <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 2.</note> well the work, but the time is not yet fit for it, I will acquaint my Friends, and fairly bid them farewell, and take my leave of <note place="margin">Lu. 9. 61.</note> them, or to be ſure will after my Fathers deceaſe, when my Eſtate is come into my own hand. I have now a buſie Calling ſaith another, a full Employment, little ſpare-time for Soul matters: But I fully purpoſe when my Children are grown up, and provided for, at leaſt when I am old or ſick; and I truſt all will be well: others again in ſuch caſes will plead, It is not my Calling; the rich may, the Miniſter muſt, I may be dſpenſed with; laſtly, ſome will ſay I fear all is too late, I deſpair of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>3. When we are invited <hi>to believe</hi> and exerciſe Faith, how is it we have ſo many Excuſes; the Promiſe is too good, I too bad, altogether unworthy, not holy, not humbled enough, the means unlikely, Providences are dark, Promiſes delayed, the Viſion doth not ſpeak; it is not with us now as with former Preſidents, God withdraws, Satan inſults, my Heart miſgives me, my Fleſh and my Heart, my Faith and Hope fail me; my Sins are too great, my Repentance
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50777:131"/> too little, for ſo many, heinous, reiterated Sins, againſt Knowledge, Conſcience, Vows, Promiſes, Corrections, Deliverances, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how ſhould I believe?</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee there is nothing but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, Excuſes at every turn, Excuſes for Sin, for Duty, for Faith, for every thing. And if we enquire into the cauſe, doth not this plainly diſcover the face of the Soul to be wofully ſmutched, our native Beauty deformed? God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but he hath ſought out many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, <hi>ratiocinia Junius</hi> renders it, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, (ſtrange Reaſonings) <hi>Computationes, Ar. Montan.</hi> Reckonings (ſtrange Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,) doth not this plainly ſhew our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is tainted, Bloud corrupted, Inwards infected? doth not this demonſtrate that we are acted, inſtructed and beguiled by the Serpent? that we have ſtrayed from God, and are eſtranged towards him; that we are unſenſible of his Purity, forgetful of his Preſence, unacquainted with the work of the Spirit, and the Inſide of his holy Law? Beſides, that we are little verſed in Conſcience-work and ſelf-examination, and that we are extream forgetful of the Day of Judgement.</p>
               <p>Again conſider, are not the Ends as baſe and ſordid? To avoid the worlds
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50777:132"/> ſhame, to gain the repute of ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs, to flap Conſcience in the mouth and muzzle it, and to procure ſome little eaſe to the Fleſh, by ſaving the labour of through converſion and ſin-mortification.</p>
               <p>Again, what is the fruit of all, is not that as bad as bad can be? to hinder all intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good, fruſtrate Gods gracious Tenders and Promiſes as much as in us is, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the way to Heaven, and to make the ſtrait Gate yet ſtraiter, to gratifie Satan, to make our ſelves utterly uncapable of mercy: what doth more confirm and harden in Sin; what doth diſcover more groſs hypocriſie than theſe Excuſes, which in word ſeem to expreſs a good inclination and willingneſs, when indeed they are flat Denyals.</p>
               <p>Yet once again conſider; will theſe bring thee into Gods preſence with any chearfulneſs, when thou art to draw nigh to him? will theſe cauſe thee to lift up thy face with joy and confidence to God? will they not make thy Spirit to faulter, thy Faith to flag, thy Hands to hang down? Can theſe ſtand before the light of Gods Word duly peruſed, or endure a through ſearch of an awakned Conſcience? when affliction comes, will not theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy trouble, adding inward to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50777:132"/> and when Death comes, will not theſe put another ſting into it, and put more poyſon into that Cup? And where wilt thou appear at the day of Judgement with theſe thy Excuſes, but be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he that ſtood ſpeechleſs, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 12.</note> to ſay for thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>And conſider laſtly, if it be not through theſe that millions of Souls do daily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and are ſhut out of Heaven, having by them ſhut themſelves out of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now lay all theſe together, and tell me ſeriouſly if here be not juſt matter of Lamentation. Sit thee down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Chriſtian, and before thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt from this, conſider if this be not, or hath not been thy caſe, and that theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excuſes have not left thee without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe at the laſt.</p>
               <p>2. From this uſe of General <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50777:133"/> know him not, what will the Lord do for us, what profit ſhall we get, if we walk humbly before him? Let us to <hi>Egypt,</hi> let who will go to <hi>Canaan</hi> that hard Land, that eateth up, maintaineth not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, give us Fleſh-pots, take you the Manna, give us the Pleaſures, take you the Recompence of Reward; we ſee no ſuch Excellency in Chriſt, Beauty in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Preciousneſs in the Promiſes, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven, as to make us willing to die to Sin and the world and our ſelves, and give up our ſelves to this ſtrange life of Auſterity, ſtrictneſs, watching, praying, Repenting, and renouncing the world: If thoſe fair Excuſes were condemned, what ſhall become of them that make foul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes and perſiſt in their Rebellions, yet the one or the other is the caſe of moſt. But that you may not think ſo ſlightly of Excuſes, we ſhall tell you a little more of their ſinfulneſs. They are the grand Sin of the world, the great Apollyon, the oldeſt mother of Iniquity, the cloſeſt Sin, that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, a Big-bellyed Monſter, hath in it all manner of ſins; rip it up and you will find it guilty of every Breach of the Law, and every miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage againſt the Goſpel.</p>

                  <hi>ſhe Gods,</hi> ſaith one of their own, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them no otherwiſe then God himſelf. They pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as to God, and preferr her ſometimes to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they call her <hi>Mother of Grace, Mother of Mercy,</hi> pray to her to deliver them from Satan, ſave them from Hell; yea, ſome have been ſo ſhameleſs as to ſay, God hath <hi>divided his Kingdom between himſelf and her,</hi> reſerving <hi>Juſtice</hi> to himſelf, and ſettling <hi>Mercy</hi> upon her; ſo that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to appeal from the Sons <hi>Juſtice</hi> to her <hi>Mercy;</hi> and that the Souls Plaiſter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50777:134"/> of the Mothers Milk and the Sons Bloud; no greater Blaſphemy or Impiety can be uttered, yet have they their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their Authority, their priviledged and allowed Books of Offices to excuſe them. Theſe things are notoriouſly known, I do therefore ſpare Quotations.

               </p>
               <p>2. As for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Commandment, concerning Inſtituted Worſhip, a world of Excuſes have been found out to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate it, till they at <hi>Rome</hi> have turned it out of the Decalogue, and ſet an <hi>Et Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera</hi> only in the room of it. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had an Excuſe for his neglect of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip in the Temple, and ſetting up his Calves, it was to eaſe the People of much unneceſſary Labour. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <note place="margin">1 K. 12. 28</note> think the ſpiritual and ſimple Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed in the Goſpel to be low, mean, untaking, therefore ſet up Image Worſhip to ſtir up Devotion, call their Images good Lay-mens Books, affirm the Image may be worſhiped with the ſame
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50777:135"/> worſhip with the Prototype, as the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix with <hi>Latreia</hi> (the ſame worſhip whch is given to the Deity) ſo it be with theſe Excuſes and Crotchets of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>improperly, reductively,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi>third</hi> comes in the Swearer with his Excuſes, may I not ſwear ſo long as it is to the Truth? again, ſo long as I do not ſwear by the Name of God, but by the Maſs, this Light, my Hand, Faith, or Troth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is forbidden by the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. By our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 35, 36. By the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. Or again, if I did not ſwear by the Name of God I may be excuſed, I ſhould not otherwiſe have been believed, or I was urged to it, or was in paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Excuſes are the great <hi>Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> If I reſt, though I ſanctifie not that Day to the ſolemn ſervice of God (pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private) may I not be excuſed? I plow not, market not, if I go to the Church, though I do nothing at home beſides before or after; If I hear a Sermon once a day, what need I go again the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time? If I keep it my ſelf, though my Servants or Children travel, ſleep, play, what is that to me? Theſe forget the Commandment runs, <hi>Thou, thy Son, thy Daughter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:50777:135"/>
               <p> 5. If we come to the ſecond Table, we ſhall find Excuſes as faulty there, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to men, as guilty of impiety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: Theſe fill Church, State, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with confuſion and diſorder. The Mother of Sedition, Rebellion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in the State, of Schiſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all good Order and Miniſtry in the Church.</p>
               <p>Somtimes in <hi>Defect.</hi> If Magiſtrates be bad, they think they may be contemned, if weak, reſiſted; If Parents old, poor, indigent, they think they may be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo taught the Corbaniſts <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 11. If Miniſters be not Eminent, or live as you would have them, ſlight them, and ſlight the Service and Offerings of the Lord, as they did upon the account of <hi>Elies</hi> Sons. If Magiſtrates be remiſs and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17. 2 Chron. 13. 7.</note> weak, caſt off their Yoke, as did <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who conſpired to depoſe his Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again in <hi>Exceſs,</hi> what Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours command, we muſt obey; as they lead, we may follow; what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, we muſt follow: They ſhall anſwer for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I have to do with my <hi>Equal,</hi> then I am as good a man as he, I'le carry no Coals. If with my <hi>Inferior,</hi> I may tread
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50777:136"/> on him, make him know I am his Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, my Servant ſhall know I am his Maſter, my Wife that I am Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. This is a great <hi>Murderer,</hi> and guilty of much Bloud. If I am affronted ſaith the Gallant, I will draw, or ſend a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: If challenged, I will not ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-man</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Gentleman</hi> my ſelf, as not to fight him. To loſe the repute of a Chriſtian (one that feareth God and the guilt of Bloud) is no diſparagement; but to loſe the reputation of a Gentleman (or indeed a <hi>Lamech)</hi> that were a perpetual <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> diſgrace. If any wrong me, ſhould I not hate him, if he provoke me, ſtrike him, and lay him at my foot? If abuſe me, may I not revenge my ſelf, and do to him as he hath done to me; never be reconciled to him again? as I hate to be falſe to my Friend, but ſhall love him as much as he loves me, ſo I will not be falſe to my ſelf, but hate an Enemy as much as he hateth me.</p>
               <p>7. This is the great Adulterer, and <hi>Mother of Whoredoms.</hi> If I commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>David;</hi> if Inceſt, <hi>Lot</hi> may Excuſe me. If I have committed Fornication, it is a Venial Sin; many of the Fools of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have done ſo before me, I am not the firſt, nor ſhall be the laſt; if I talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50777:136"/> and ſpeak ſcurrilouſly, it is but to make my ſelf and others merry, and words are but wind; if I have a wanton Eye, or luſtful Thoughts, Thoughts are free, what hath any to do with them?</p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Eighth</hi> Commandement is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away by Excuſes. If I ſteal, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo then ſtarve. If I be falſe to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaid the unjuſt Steward, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Blame me not if I deſire to live, I have nothing to live upon but my Wits, better ſo than dig, or beg, or be caſhiered. If I rack my Tenants, may I not make the beſt of my own? If I over-reach in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining <hi>Caveat Emptor,</hi> may I not ſell my Commodity as dear as I can? If I ſpend all, it is but my own; if I hoard up all, lend, ſpend, give nothing, may I not pleaſe my ſelf? If I have an advantage againſt my Neighbour, and take it, vexing him with troubleſome Suits in Law; the Law, not I am to be blamed. If I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sacriledge, the Church hath enough, and too much already; It is but a piece of a Babyloniſh Garment, given to the Church in times of blind Superſtition. If I pay not my Tythes, the Parſon comes eaſily enough by his Living. Thus is there no Eighth Commandement.</p>
               <p>9. For the <hi>Ninth,</hi> we may ſay Excuſes
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50777:137"/> were a <hi>Lyar</hi> from the beginning, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in the truth, and yet pleads for all manner of untruths. If I tell an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, the Jeſting Lye doth no man harm, the Officious Lye doth a deal of good to my Friend. The Excuſatory Lye hideth a fault and ſaveth anger, yea the pernitious defaming Lye will have ſomewhat to defend it ſelf. I have now cryed Quit with him, he reviled me and I have reviled him; if ſlander, it was my Enemy. If I take up an ill Report and ſpread it, you have it as I had it, I was not the Author of it; yea, if I make Oath to a falſe Charge, it is but what is put in my mouth, and others will ſecond it. Thus is there no Ninth Commandement left neither.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as for <hi>Coveting,</hi> what Excuſes have men ready to juſtifie any thing? If my Neighbour hath Field, or Tenement that lyeth convenient for me, why may I not ſeek to add Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field? by fair means if it may be, as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Naboth,</hi> or elſe out him by Law and diſpoſſeſs him if that will not do, as did <hi>Jezabel</hi> by a Wile and Quirk in the Law; or play the Sycophant, and forge ſome cavilling Accuſation, to pick a hole in his Coat, as ſometimes <hi>Zacheus</hi> had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50777:137"/> done; or by flattering Inſinuations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine him as <hi>Ziba</hi> did <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> or if I envy, repine at, or maligne my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good, what hath any to do with that? Thus have Excuſes made void the whole Law, and not left one unviolated.</p>
               <p>2. As Excuſes are ſuch capital offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt the Law, they are as much againſt <hi>the Goſpel too,</hi> endangering the fruſtrating of Gods Counſel, ſlighting the offers and tenders of Grace, as thoſe in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. Thereby recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Grace of God in vain, or turning it into wantonneſs, or ſlipping the ſeaſon and opportunity of the day of Grace, as if he that out of Grace ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long, were bound to ſtretch it out all their life long to a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and gainſaying people.</p>
               <p>2. Are as injurious <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> ſlighting his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Kingly</hi> power, becauſe his Viſage ſo marred, Outſide ſo mean, Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſo low, Followers ſo inconſiderable, his Precepts ſo pure, Yoke ſo ſtrict, Croſs <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 6.</note> ſo heavy and ignominious, that he goes for a bleſſed man that was or is not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in him. They caſt him out of the Vineyard, and had a reaſon for it, then the Inheritance was their own. They take <note place="margin">Mat. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38.</note> away his Life, and have a Law and great
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50777:138"/> Reaſon of State for it, to prevent the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſubjugation. Excuſes have baniſhed the Goſpel, becauſe it brings a Religion and Laws, different from former Cuſtoms, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 21. have made the Jews to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Ro. 10. 23.</note> having a Legal Righteouſneſs of their own, have emboldened the Papiſts to joyn other Mediators with Chriſt, as the Bleſſed Virgin, and their Patron Saints, to mingle the Bloud of Chriſt with that of Martyrs, their own Merits, Pardons, Pennances, Satisfactions, all to Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (but indeed to Invalidate) the alone all-ſufficient Satisfaction of Chriſt. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes have corrupted the Doctrine of Grace laid down, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 22. that Grace ſhould reign by Righteouſneſs; have made Chriſt the Patron and Miniſter of Sin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. becauſe he came to ſave Sinners; in a word, have ſubverted the whole Goſpel, perverting the Doctrines of Juſtification, Faith, Repentance Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins, to encourage men to ſin, and preſume with the greater ſecurity.</p>
               <p>3. Excuſes have ſinned againſt <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſighting and putting by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Excitations, Convictions, as did <hi>Felix,</hi> not regarding his preſent, firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>3. Excuſes are of ſo evil and malignant aſpect, that they have turned all things unto Sin, that they have had to do with; increaſing to more ungodlineſs, making ill uſe of Gods Decrees, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10.

Obedience, that again calls for the Heart, Spirit, Faith, Fear, Love, Diligence, Care, Conſcience, Patience, Conſtancy, Proficiency, Perſeverance. As for Faith, that is to be grounded on the Promiſes, and maintained by ſtudying them, eying Precepts, Conditions, Threats, frequent Prayers, and by a conſtant courſe of obedience and ſincerity of Heart. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity likewiſe calls for much Inſpection of our Hearts, Examination of our Wayes, and State, much eying of God, ſearching the Scriptures, obſerving our ſelves, avoiding of ſins and occaſions of Sin, performing Duties, cloſe and ſtrict walking with God, and according to his word.

See the folly and falſhood of that common Proverb, <hi>A bad Excuſe is better than none at all:</hi> We may invert it and ſay, Better no Excuſe, than the beſt of them all, which make men double guilty, by adding ſin to ſin, and ſinful Evaſions and Excuſes to ſinful Actions; the godly ſincere man is the happieſt man in the world, that in this ſenſe he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without Excuſe, as needing none, the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50777:141"/> only Excuſeleſs perſon in the world, and the more excuſed, becauſe he hath the fewer Excuſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What a ſad <hi>difference</hi> is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gods Care</hi> of mans ſalvation, and <hi>Mans Care,</hi> or rather <hi>Careleſneſs?</hi> What could God do more, he provideth a Feaſt, inviteth the Gueſts, ſends out his Servants once and again, <hi>Come, all is ready,</hi> Mercy is ready to ſave you; what could Man do leſs to ſave himſelf, or more to undo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſlighting all by frivolous Excuſes? The Shepherd doth all he can to preſerve his Flock, and the ſilly Sheep love to ſtray and wander, and ſo become a Prey to the devouring Wolf. The tender Mother would keep the Child in her Lap, and that ſeeks to get looſe, and meets with a knock. The Mother puts on fair Cloaths to keep her Child clean, and the firſt thing the Child doth, is to paddle in the Dirt, and make a Beaſt of it ſelf. The Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides his Son a Portion and ſets him up, that he may live like a Man, and he by improvidence makes all away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Beggar. Here is much Care on the one hand, and woful Careleſneſs on the other; yet neither Shepherd, Father or Mother, are blamed in the former Caſes; but here all is caſt upon God, as if we would
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50777:142"/> father and faſten our perdition upon him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This ſhews us what a vaſt <hi>difference</hi> there is upon this account, between the Sincere and the Hypocrite, in 3 reſpects. 1. The <hi>ſincere</hi> doth all he can to fortifie himſelf by ſerious Arguments and Excuſes againſt Sin, and for Duty. How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God? <note place="margin">Gen. 39 9.</note> The other doth all he can, beats his Brains, ſtudies Arguments, baffles his Conſcience, frames Excuſes to fortifie himſelf againſt Duty, and to encourage himſelf unto ſin.</p>
               <p>2. What a difference is there between the one <hi>Excuſing,</hi> applauding and admiring his ſtate, and the other <hi>queſtioning,</hi> ſuſpecting and diſliking his ſtate, judging and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf. The proud Phariſee cryes up his own Righteouſneſs, and his many good Deeds: The poor Publican cryes out of his Sins, and begs for Mercy. Holy <hi>Job</hi> abhorrs himſelf in Duſt and Aſhes, and wicked <hi>Saul</hi> extolls himſelf to the Sky, I <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 13.</note> have done all that the Lord commanded me. The holy Apoſtles ſuſpect themſelves, and in an holy Jealouſie ſay, Is it I? and impudent <hi>Judas</hi> full of deſperate Malice, dips in the Diſh, and looks his Maſter in the face, and ſaith, what, is it I? Humble <hi>Smyrna</hi> bewayls her Poverty and Defects, when the Lord ſaid ſhe was Rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. And
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50777:142"/> vapouring <hi>Laodicea</hi> vaunts of her Riches, when the Lord ſaith ſhe was wretched, and miſerable poor.</p>
               <p>3. As to confeſſing, and concealing Sin: The one doth freely and voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, the other uſeth all his skil to deny or conceal it. <hi>Judah</hi> unasked, unforced, ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I ſay; God hath found out our Sins,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 44. 16.</note> when indeed there was pure Innocence; <hi>Gehazi</hi> queſtioned and examined, denyes the Fact, <hi>Thy Servant hath been no where.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 25.</note> What a difference was there between <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Repentance, and ſenſe of Sin, and <hi>Saul</hi>'s unſenſibleneſs. The one cryes out, I have done fooliſhly, it is I, what <hi>have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe Sheep done?</hi> The other ſaid, It is not I that ſinned, but theſe Sheep, <hi>the People</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>that went with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This ſhews us what a <hi>difference</hi> there is between <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Judgement</hi> of himſelf, and Gods Judgment. Let but Man be his own Judge, he hath ſo many fair Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, none would be guilty; but when God enters into Judgement with him, there is none will be found innocent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What a <hi>difference</hi> is there between a man's judgement <hi>of Sin</hi> at preſent while Conſcience is benummed, they make a mock of Sin, make light of Reproofs and Threats, and pleaſe themſelves in their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50777:143"/> Excuſes, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> and when Conſcience is awakened and affrighted, how have they then thrown away all their Excuſes, turning all into ſelf-accuſation, ſelf-condemnation, utter deſperation, and ſometimes <hi>ſelf-deſtruction?</hi> Deſperate <hi>Cain</hi> cryes out, Now I ſee what Sin is, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend mine ſo great, as it cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. And curſed <hi>Judas</hi> cryes out, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> I have ſinned, the Bloud of the Son of God rings in my Ears, and cryes for Vengeance; and I, whither ſhall I cauſe my Shame, my Sin and Guilt, and Horror to go?</p>
               <p n="8">8. This may inform us again (and think ſeriouſly of it,) what a <hi>difference</hi> there is in <hi>God's Carriage</hi> now to man, and man's to God, to what it will be in <hi>that day.</hi> Firſt, God here calls men graciouſly, <hi>beſeeeheth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>them to be Reconciled,</hi> offers Grace, Mercy and Forgiveneſs freely; but then the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will find the Caſe altered, Man will be the <hi>Petitioner</hi> then, and beſeech God to be reconciled, and beg for Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs in vain; for then is the time of <hi>retribution,</hi> and God will deal with Man, as he had dealt with him before. There is now Intreating on God's part, and Slighting on Man's. But oh! what intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will there be then on Man's part, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50777:143"/> ſlighhting on God's! wretched Man ſlights God's Grace, Promiſes, Precepts, Threats here, and God will ſlight man's Cry, Tears, Prayers, Repentance, and Torments there. God muſt have thee Excuſed when thou goeſt on in thy Sin, and thou muſt have God Excuſed when thou goeſt on to thy puniſhment. There Excuſes will be met withal in their kind, and match'd with Excuſes. When God calls, thou ſayeſt <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me,</hi> if I ſhew no Obedience, and when thou calleſt, God will ſay, <hi>Excuſe me,</hi> if I <note place="margin">

Thou couldeſt formerly be full of Sin, yet full of Hope, and I am now full of wrath to thee, yet a God full of mercy: You once ſaid, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould ſerve him? and now ſaith the Lord, who are ye, that I ſhould ſave you? you then ſaid to me, I know thee not, now I anſwer you in your own Language, <hi>I know you not:</hi> It was once your anſwer to me, <hi>Depart from us,</hi> it is now my final anſwer to you, <hi>Depart</hi> for ever from me, ye deſpiſers of my mercy; you once mocked at my Threats, and laught at my Commands, and I <hi>will alſo</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2. There will be old pleading then, to little purpoſe; thou wilt then be aſhamed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50777:144"/> of theſe pleas, it was my Nature, Cuſtom I had got, it was in my Drink, Paſſion, or the like.</p>
               <p>3. It will be in vain to ſay, Lord, Lord, I was a Chriſtian, profeſſor of Religion, a conſtant Church-man, I have heard thee preach in the Synagogues, teaching in our Streets, or Houſes, I have eat and drank in thy preſence, and at thy Table, done many good works, and ſpoke many good words.</p>
               <p>4. It will be to as little purpoſe to ſay, Lord, I truſted in thy mercy, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpel, to the Bloud of thy Son, when the Lord ſhall reply, My <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> was declared to them <hi>that fear me;</hi> my <hi>Goſpel</hi> for them that deny ungodlineſs, and <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 50. Tit. 2. 12. 1 Jo. 1. 7.</note> live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly,</hi> my Son's Bloud was ſhed to <hi>cleanſe,</hi> and take away Sin. I am amazed, and tremble to think what amazement and horror will then ſeize on all workers of Iniquity, when they ſee themſelves thus diſappointed of all their Lying hopes, and it calls to my mind the ſad plight that that curſed <hi>Haman</hi> was in, when he ſaw the <hi>King, Queen, Mordecai, Harbonah,</hi> all againſt him. The Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he ſo relyed upon, that he never queſtioned a change, he could but ask and have. The Queen had invited him, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50777:144"/> none but him to a Banquet, <hi>Harbonah</hi> was one of thoſe that bowed to him, <hi>Mordecai</hi> was the only man he meant to Ruine; but now on a ſudden the Scene is changed, his Plots fail, his Sin is diſcovered, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> is advanced, the Queen that Feaſted him is his Accuſer, and it was in vain to fall down and beg Mercy, the King, whoſe favour he had abuſed, pronounceth Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and he is immediately hurried to Execution, and made a Spectacle to all the Court, and a dreadful Example of God's juſt Judgement to all ages. <hi>Harbonah,</hi> and all Officers about the Court, not once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their mouth in his behalf, but all ready to aggravate his Crimes, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like or worſe, will be thy caſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Sinner, who now rely'ſt on the mercy of God, the bloud of Chriſt, the promiſes of the Goſpel, and the many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours God hath beſtowed on thee, all which thou haſt made ill uſe of: Thou wilt find to thy ſorrow, God, Chriſt, the Goſpel, all the former ſavours and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, riſe up againſt thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, and none to ſpeak a good word for thee (Angels or Men) but to aggravate thy Offences, and then will it

               <p>5. Conſider what will be in that day, when God ſhall ſummon all the World together, both good and bad, face to face; what fending and proving, what accuſing and excuſing will there then be? The Friend will not ſpare to accuſe his Friend, to ſave himſelf; the Child the Father; the Husband the Wife; the Adulterer and Adultereſs, will each impeach other; the people cry out of their ſilent, or ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Miniſters, and all ſay, It is long of you, that I am in this place of Torments, <hi>my Bloud be upon your Head:</hi> Had it not been for your Perſwaſion, Counſel, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, Example, I had never been ſo bad then, or ſo miſerable now. Then will thoſe that were thy Companions in Sin, leave thee in the Lurch, as the Prieſts did <hi>Judas,</hi> to ſhift for thy ſelf, <hi>See thou to that.</hi> There will wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> who ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs, ſee himſelf ſtript naked of all his old Excuſes, and cry out, and condemn himſelf (unhappy, accurſed <hi>Ahab)</hi> and juſtifie <hi>Elias, Micaiah, Naboth,</hi> ſaying, Oh, that I had never wronged, hated, or perſecuted you! <hi>Curſed Covetouſneſs!</hi> that ſet me on to deſire my

Curſed <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> to ſend me to <hi>Ramoth Gilead!</hi> Curſed <hi>Satan,</hi> who put that deluſive anſwer into their mouths! And curſed <hi>my ſelf</hi> moſt of all, who ſold my ſelf to work wickedneſs! It is I, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy I, that muſt now pay for all.</p>
               <p>9. This may <hi>inform</hi> us further, that fair words, <hi>good Language,</hi> and civil Carriage, may be ſhut out of Heaven, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Perſecution, and ſlighting of Mercy. Thoſe in the Parable had ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretences, delivered themſelves in fair Language, I pray thee have me Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and I pray thee have me excuſed, ſaid the two firſt, neither of them ſaid, I <hi>will not,</hi> I care not: one ſaid, I <hi>cannot,</hi> but none, I will not, yet all ſhut out. Truſt not then to good words, and a plauſible Carriage.</p>
               <p>10. This may inform us again, that Heaven may be loſt by an <hi>undue,</hi> eager, and immoderate purſuit of things <hi>Lawful, following our Callings,</hi> Trade and Buſineſs: the Oxen, Farm, and Wedlock, are to be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50777:146"/> regarded, but in a lower and ſubordinate meaſure; never to juſtle out the one thing neceſſary. The great <hi>Husband,</hi> and good <hi>Huſwife,</hi> may be as far from Heaven, as the Spendthriſt, and ill Huſwife. <hi>One Calling</hi> minded, makes not the Chriſtian, without the other. Reſt not then, in thy diligence and painfulneſs, in thy outward Calling.</p>
               <p>11. Laſtly, this informs us, that <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Duties alone, make not a Compleat Chriſtian, if Religious Relations be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as they oft are. I <hi>have marryed a Wife, and therefore I cannot come:</hi> Cannot the Wife be obſerved and reſpected, but God muſt be unſerved, and neglected? It is ſmall commendation, to be the moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Husband, and the beſt Wife in the world, if not alſo the beſt Chriſtian. To be the moſt provident, and indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt dutiful Child; if regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of God. What a Soleciſm and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity is that, the Man to have great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Wife, little to God; the Wife careful to pleaſe the Husband, careleſs of pleaſing Chriſt; a Child dutiful to Father, diſobedient to God; a Subject loyal to his Prince, diſloyal to his God, and a Rebel; true to thy Countrey, and falſe to thy God? This is to be faithful in the little,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50777:146"/> and unfaithful in the much and main. There are <hi>Relations</hi> wherein all ſtand in <hi>to God,</hi> have an equal regard to theſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Duties,</hi> relating to God, as to them to men, and thou art the right Chriſtian.</p>

                  <hi>me, and if I have done Iniquity, I will do ſo no more.</hi> This is the Character of a gracious Heart, the Language of a <hi>willing people.</hi> This Obedience is above Sacrifice, and readineſs to hearken, above the fat of Lambs. But if thou ſtudieſt delays, and put-offs, <hi>Let me firſt bury my Father, Bid my Friends farewell, try my Oxen, ſettle my Land,</hi> &amp;c. Take heed thou be not ſet down Tardy, Delinquent, and Recuſant. Good people are the only <hi>Excuſeleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> wicked all Excuſes.</p>
               <p>2. Doſt thou <hi>furniſh,</hi> and fortifie thy ſelf with good Excuſes, to keep thee ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,

That thou haſt had a good intention, blind zeal, vows, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, oaths, many good duties, a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or relative righteouſneſs, diligence in thy Calling, conformity to humane Laws, and the like, which may plead thy Excuſe; I teſtifie againſt thee, and aſſure thee, all theſe will prove a Curtaild Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, too ſhort and ſcant to cover thy nakedneſs, as the Prophet ſaith. <hi>And</hi>

               <p>The laſt uſe of Exhortation or Dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:50777:149"/>
               <p> I ſhall make no uſe of <hi>Reproof,</hi> the whole Diſcourſe hath run that way, to reprove the Sin of Excuſes. But our laſt Uſe ſhall be of Exhortation, and if I could make it an Uſe of <hi>Remove,</hi> I ſhould not repent my pains. It is the uſual manner of others, when they have been perſwading and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Hearers or Readers to any good, to conclude with <hi>Exhortation;</hi> I that have been all this while diſſuading from Evil, ſhall conclude with <hi>Dehortations,</hi> and as they do uſually back their Exhortations with Motives, I ſhall make it my deſign, to make my Dehortation from Excuſes, to take effect by ſome <hi>Remotives</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movers; and there are four <hi>Removes</hi> I ſhall commend to the Chriſtian Reader to prevent Excuſes, and then commend all to God.</p>
               <p>And the firſt <hi>Remove</hi> of Excuſes, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and hearty <hi>obedience,</hi> get and practiſe this, and it is better then all Excuſes; it prevents and removes them, ſo that there is no need of them at all. The Angel that could ſay, <hi>I have done as thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me,</hi> Ezek. 9. 11. hath no need of any Excuſe, nor did <hi>Adam</hi> need or uſe any in his Innocency.</p>
               <p>2. The next Remove, is <hi>Repentance.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our obedience is imperfect, (not as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50777:149"/> the Angels unfallen, or as <hi>Adams</hi> before his fall) our next courſe is Repentance, our <hi>Secunda poſt Naufragium Tabula;</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all other frivolous Excuſes, fly to this, this the beſt Remove next to Obedience. This procures a <hi>Deleatur,</hi> a cancelling of the Bill, a blotting out all our Sins, ſo is Gods promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. Now where there is a removal, blotting out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, there needs no more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or covering of Sin; when ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, it is therefore ſaid to be covered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is he, whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered, bleſsed is he to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe Bleſſings came upon the truly penitent. And therefore there is no more need of Excuſes, where there is no Sin. Repentance is the beſt Excuſe, Apology, or clearing of our ſelves, as the Apoſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>(Beza</hi> renders it <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatio,</hi> and ſo is the ſignification of the word grammatically:) it procures a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which no other Plea, or Apology can, and that gives a Covering, which all the Excuſes in the world can never do. Of other Coverings that may be ſaid, which the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30. 1. <hi>They co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a Covering, but not of my Spirit, adding ſin to ſin;</hi> add Excuſes to Excuſes,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50777:150"/> and you add Sin to Sin. <hi>He that ſo covereth</hi>

                  <hi>his ſins ſhall never proſper,</hi> but he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and forſaketh ſhall find mercy; you will <hi>cover,</hi> and God will <hi>diſcover:</hi> But true Repentance is a great <hi>Cover-ſin.</hi> This was the way which <hi>David</hi> took for clearing himſelf, and to have his Sin covered, he confeſſed, repented, cryed out, <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

Not guilty is the worſt Plea we can make at Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and to ſtand upon our Innocency. <hi>Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am Innocent, I will plead with thee,</hi> Jer. 2. 35. <hi>Job</hi> durſt not ſtand to this plea, <hi>If I am righteous,</hi> ſaid <note place="margin">Job 9. 15.</note> he, I would not anſwer God ſo, <hi>but make my ſupplication,</hi> (as an humble Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) to my Judge; our beſt way of ſpeeding in Gods Court, contrary to what of man's, is to ſue in <hi>forma pauperis,</hi> in <hi>forma peccatoris: If I ſhould waſh my ſelf in Snow water</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> again, <hi>and make</hi>

                  <hi>my Hands never ſo clean, yet thou ſhalt plunge me in the Ditch, and make my Clothes to abhor me,</hi> my Excuſes with which I would cover my Sin, would leave me in a worſe pickle of pollution. That vile <hi>Shimei</hi> ſped better at <hi>Davids</hi> hands, upon <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 19, 20.</note> his ſpeedy, and humbe ſubmiſſion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement

                  <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Crown,</hi> or thoſe perfidious Brethren, that brought <hi>Iſhboſheths</hi> Head, when the one knew himſelf to be an offender, and the three laſt, thought they had merited, and looked for a reward. The penitent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal had better Entertainment at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands, that cryed out, <hi>Father, I have ſinned,</hi> then the elder Brother, that plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had never offended. <hi>Judahs</hi> Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous confeſſion of the miſcarriage, what ſhall we ſay, or how can we clear our ſelves, the Fact is apparent, God hath brought our Sins to light, we are all thy Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo wrought upon <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bowels, that he could not ſpeak one rough word more, but fell to embracing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them.</p>
               <p>3. In the third place, becauſe both <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are defective, our next Remove, is to fly to the bloud of Chriſt by Faith, and this three-fold Cord will be ſure to hold faſt the Anchor of thy Soul. This is the only ſafe <hi>remove</hi> to truſt to, and this gives a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> to all other Excuſes. Repentance is a good Cover-ſin, in ſome caſes, and goes a great way; but the Bloud of Chriſt is all in all, when all is <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 7. 9.</note> done, to cover and take away Sin, it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50777:151"/> cleanſeth us from all unrighteouſneſs. It was not all ſorrow and contrition, but the offenders highing and flying to the City of Refuge, and abiding there, which <note place="margin">Num. 35. 25.</note> did Excuſe and ſecure him from the hands of the Avenger. And the death of the High Prieſt, did fully acquit him from his Crime. Chriſt is our great, and only Excuſe-maker, our only Advocate and Mediator; and if be he our Apologiſt, we ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without Excuſe, in a good ſenſe. Who is he that will contend with me, ſaith the penitent and believing Soul, flying to Chriſt, <hi>He is near that Juſtifieth me;</hi> who <note place="margin">Eſay. 50. 8</note> is he that will condemn, Chriſt hath died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he maketh Interceſſion for us; and his Interceſſion is above all the Pleas we can make for our ſelves. <hi>Benjamin</hi> came off better, by <hi>Judahs</hi> interceding for him, and <hi>Nabal</hi> by <hi>Abigals,</hi> then if either had ſpoken the beſt they could, in their own behalf. This made the Apoſtle deſire to be found in Chriſt, not in his own righteouſneſs. The Righteouſneſs of <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> Chriſt, if we ſpeak properly, is the only <hi>Cover-ſin,</hi> and his Bloud the only Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Interceſſion our beſt plea and defence, and true Faith our beſt Title and Claim. <hi>By him all that believe are Juſtified</hi> (there's our ſafety) <hi>from all which</hi>

                  <hi>we could not be Juſtified by the Law,</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>And to this give all the Prophets</hi>

                  <hi>witneſs, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive forgiveneſs of Sins;</hi> and where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is granted, there is no more need of Excuſes. Chriſt ſaith to the troubled Soul, that is perplexed to think what anſwer to make, as to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> mourning, <hi>why weepeſt thou?</hi> what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth thee? is it any want? He ſaith as the good old man to the Levite, that knew not where to Lodge, <hi>Peace be to thee, let</hi>

                  <hi>all thy wants be upon me.</hi> Is it Debt? He hath undertaken, and ſpeaks to his Father in thy behalf, as <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus, If he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Philem. 6. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>bath wronged, or oweth any thing, put that on my account.</hi> Is it Sin? He ſaith in thy behalf, interceding for thee, as <hi>Abigal</hi> to <hi>David. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon me, upon me, let this Iniquity be charged.</hi> He was made Sin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Is it the Fathers Wrath and Curſe thou feareſt, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his Fathers? He ſatisfieth thee in the words of <hi>Rebecka</hi> to her Son, <hi>Fear not, upon me be the Curſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 13.</note>

               <p>4. The fourth and laſt way to make ſure againſt all ſorry and beggarly Excuſes, is to furniſh thy ſelf with ſolid, ſubſtantial,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50777:152"/> and unexceptible Excuſes, ſuch as can't be excepted againſt, ſuch as the Servants of God of old were wont to repel any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, or diverſion from duty by, whereof I ſhall inſtance in five out of the Old Teſtament, and as many out of the New.</p>

                  <hi>my own Life, for nothing is hid from the King, and thou thy ſelf wouldſt have ſet thy ſelf againſt me.</hi> In which his Anſwer, he giveth in four weighty Reaſons for his Excuſe. 1. It were not ſafe for me to go againſt the expreſs Charge of my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, at the pleaſure of any Subordinate, how great ſoever. 2. For thy thouſand Shekles, I ſhould have paid dear for them, they would have coſt me my Life, and I love not to buy Gold or Honour at ſo dear a rate; what good would the thouſand Shekles, and the Girdle do me, If I muſt die, as ſoon as I ſhould require them? and <hi>I ſhould have wrought the greateſt falſhood againſt my own Life,</hi> whch is more dear to me, than any Riches or Honour. 3. To be ſure it would come out, <hi>Nothing is hid from the King.</hi> Kings have many Eyes, and many Ears abroad, and ſee more than others. 4. Thou thy ſelf, who ſetteſt me on, when the matter ſhould come to be ſcanned, couldſt not carry me through, but wouldſt have been a Witneſs againſt me. Wiſe, and weighty Conſiderations all. Oh, that we had the like in readineſs, when tempted with whatſoever promiſes againſt the known Will of God. 1. I may not diſobey my Chief, and the ſupream God, to gratifie any Inferiour whatſoever.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50777:153"/> 2. What ſhould I Get, and what would it profit me, to gain the whole World, and to loſe my own Soul. What folly or madneſs ſo <hi>great, as to be falſe to my own Soul?</hi> The Soul is of more worth, than all the Shekles, Girdles, Offices and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World. 3. To be ſure <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hid</hi> from the Eyes of him with whom we have to do, Kings have many Eyes, God is <hi>Totus oculus,</hi> all Eyes. 4. That is no laſting friendſhip which engageth thee to ſin, <hi>Thou thy ſelf wouldſt be againſt me.</hi> He that is ſo forward to thruſt thee into Sin, will be the firſt to come in againſt thee, and when thou comeſt to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, will leave thee in the Lurch, when their own turn is ſerved.</p>
               <p>4. Noble and magnanimous was that <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 3.</note> Anſwer, returned by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> with others, ſought by ſeveral Meſſages and Fetches, to divert him, and take him off from the Work, wherein he was engaged, he would not ſo much as once ſpeak with them, but ſends them this peremptory Anſwer for his Excuſe. <hi>I am about a great Work, I cannot come down to you, why ſhould the Work ceaſe, while I leave it to come to you?</hi> They gave not over, but never left ſending Meſſage after Meſſage, four or five times;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50777:153"/> but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was <hi>the ſame man ſtill,</hi> and ſtuck to his former Reſolution. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when thou art engaged in any Work, or Concern of God, it may be when but in thy Cloſet, the World, or thy carnal Friends, or thy outward Fleſh may ſeek to divert and intercept thee; and thou haſt no better Anſwer to return, then to ſay, <hi>I am about a great Work,</hi> Gods Work, Soul Work, <hi>I cannot come down,</hi> it muſt not be left ſo. Thou muſt take up <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s Reſolution, when thou art entred upon any good Courſe, or all will come to nothing. <hi>Non Vacat</hi> is a better Plea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <note place="margin">Ep. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon.</hi>

               <p>5. The laſt Example of Excuſe, out of the Old Teſtament, which I ſhall mention, is that of the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> who, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited <note place="margin">Jer. 35.</note> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and that by Gods own direction (to take tryal of their temperance and obedience) into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a good man, <hi>Igdaliah</hi> the man of God, where there was ſtore of Wine in Cups and Flagons, not one of them would taſt a Cup, but Excuſed themſelves by this, <hi>our Father</hi> Jonadab <hi>hath charged us to the contrary.</hi> Oh, where ſhall we find theſe <hi>Rechabites</hi> now! whenſoever thou art tempted to drink to Exceſs, return the

                  <hi>drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs,</hi> my Lord and Saviour hath given me a Charge, <hi>Let not your Hearts be ſurcharged with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting</hi>

                  <hi>and drunkenneſs, leſt that day come upon you unawares.</hi> And although thou mayeſt be reproached for thy over niceneſs, by a company of Epicures and Atheiſts, it may be the Lord will ſay of thy Houſe, as of the <hi>Rechabites, Thy Houſe ſhall ſtand</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 35. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and continue before him, when they have drunk out theirs, and theirs have ſpued out them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. From the Old Teſtament, we ſhall paſs to the New Teſtament, and with whom ſhall we begin, but with him who is the Example above all Examples, our Bleſſed Saviour? who, when he had been abſent, and miſſed by his Parents, and carefully ſought for, up and down among their Kindred and Friends, was at length ſound in the Temple among the Doctors, hearing, and asking them Queſtions, whom, when his Mother mildly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, <hi>Why haſt thou thus dealt with us, behold thy Father and I have ſought thee ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</hi> His Reply and Excuſe was, <hi>I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs.</hi> Here you have the Example of a careful Mother, and of a more careful Son. She full of care for her Sons welfare, he of Religious
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50777:154"/> Care of his Fathers Concerns. <hi>Bleſſed Mother of God!</hi> why ſhouldeſt thou take on ſo, and be ſorry! Thy Son was not out of his way, when thou ſoughteſt him, but thy ſelf; thou mighteſt be ſure to find him out of harms way, not among the Truants, but the Doctors, nor in the ſtreets, but in the Temple, whither he did all his Life after continually reſort. <hi>Ob Bleſſed Son of God,</hi> to be ſo careful of thy Fathers Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when ſo young! and I not yet, when ſo old! Thou ſo forward, and I ſo backward! Thy Sun was up betimes, and moved (as the Sun in the Heaven) with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſpeedy motion in the morning, as at high noon. And our Sun riſeth not till Noon, breaks not out ſometimes till Even, before the ſetting. Thy Sun never had Solſtice, all thy Life was motion, action, going about doing good, teaching, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeking to ſave what was loſt. And we ſo many Solſtices and irregular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thy forwardneſs condemns our bacwardneſs, and thy Excuſe is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and leaves us without Excuſe.</p>
               <p>Here is a Pattern for <hi>you Youths,</hi> that are all for Play and Sports, remember your Saviour in the morning of his Youth, before he was yet entred into the Teens (when but twelve Years old) was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50777:155"/> found not in the ſtreets among Play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but in the Temple among the grave Doctors; nor as a ſpectator of them, or Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer on the Structure and Ornaments of the Temple, but an attentive Auditor; and as a great Proficient, was able both to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and anſwer with ſo much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as was admirable, about matters of Religion. Learn thou the way to the Temple, and the place where the Teachers meet, to reverence and attend to them, that thy profiting may appear by thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and anſwers, and enable thy ſelf for holy Conference. Here is an Example alſo for Gentlemen and thoſe of higheſt Birth, your <hi>High born Lord</hi> was not found among his Kinsfolks and Friends, as if his Buſineſs was to pay Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities to friends, and acquaintance, to give and receive Viſits and Treatments, which is all the account ſome can give of their time ſpending; nor was he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in the Tavern or Theater; but now and after conſtantly in the Temple. But alas, how many are there whom you may ſeek long enough ere you find them in the Temple; in the Tavern every day, at the Temple ſeldom; at the Theater they never miſs, among they Players; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Doctors, or Teachers ſeldom,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50777:155"/> ſpecially expreſſing any reverence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but as if they came rather to ſcoff than learn. But let ſuch conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, can they ſay, if asked what makeſt thou here? <hi>I am about my Fathers Buſineſs.</hi> Yea, this may be an Example <hi>to all men</hi> to attend their Callings, and to mind the Buſineſs which God ſets them to do, <hi>Miniſter Verbi es? hoc age,</hi> was famous <hi>Perkins</hi>'s Motto, that whereſoever thou art found, <hi>thou mayſt be found ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>2. We muſt obey God rather than men, is a juſt Excuſe, when God commands one thing and man another, as was the caſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> when <note place="margin">Acts 5. 28, 29.</note> they returned that anſwer to the High Prieſts Charge, of Preaching no more in the Name of Chriſt.

As to Evil. 2. As to Good. 3. As to the Law preſcribing good, forbidding Evil. 1. As to <hi>Evil,</hi> canſt thou ſay, That there is no Evil thou doſt <hi>allow thy ſelf in, v.</hi> 15. 2. No beloved Sin, <hi>The Evil which I hate, v.</hi> 15. 3. No voluntary, wilful Sin, <hi>That which I would not, v.</hi> 16. and. 19.</p>
               <p>2. As to <hi>good,</hi> 1. though I fail in doing, I fail not in <hi>deſiring,</hi> in indeavouring. My will is good, though performance poor, to will is preſent with me, though how to perform what is good in ſuch a manner as
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50777:157"/> I would, I find not. 2. Of all good, he ſaith, <hi>It is that he loves, it is the good he would</hi> v. 19.</p>
               <p>3. As to the <hi>Law</hi> preſcribing Good, and forbidding Evil, canſt thou ſay as he did, 1. <hi>That the Law is holy, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement holy, juſt and good? v.</hi> 12. A wicked man will ſay the Commandement is holy and juſt (it may be too holy and too juſt,) but how to call it <hi>good</hi> he can hardly tell, it doth ſo meet with him and croſs his Luſts.</p>
               <p>2. Canſt thou ſay thou conſenteſt and ſubſcribeſt to the Equity and Purity of the Law, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>I conſent to the Law that it is good.</hi> I tell you it is a gracious Heart that can ſay ſo, I like not the Law the worſe for its ſtrictneſs and purity, I find no fault with Gods holy Law, all the fault I find is with my own unholy Heart, I wiſh not for a better Law, but a better Heart.</p>
               <p>3. And canſt thou ſay further, <hi>Thou delighteſt in the Law of God, and in thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Man, v.</hi> 22. That thou doſt heartily cloſe with that though it make againſt thee, and command more and better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then thou doſt perform, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and threaten Sin.</p>
               <p>I ſay this is a fair conflicting man's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50777:157"/> and doth clear thee from being a Hypocrite.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt Excuſe, and that which is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for us in our frail and imperfect eſtate to fly unto, with which I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe, and with which I heartily wiſh thou and I may conclude our Lives, <hi>is to fly to Chriſt.</hi> This is our <hi>ultimum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugium,</hi> our laſt refuge, when all fails, and we are by Satan beaten out of all our holds and pleas. This is the Excuſe Saint <hi>John</hi> furniſheth us withall, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (and he that ſaith he doth not, is a Lyar) <hi>We have, ſaith he, an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Chriſt is our Advocate, Spokeſman, Surety, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe-maker. An Advocate is properly one that is of Councel for a Client to aſſiſt him and plead his Cauſe in Court, which he cannot ſo well do for himſelf. Chriſt is ſuch an Advocate. It were ill with us if we were to plead our own Cauſe and to anſwer for our ſelves. But if Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for us there is no fear of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, how deplorate and deſperate ſoever thou judgeſt thy Caſe. He hath carryed the whole Company of Believers (and ſome of them had been as great ſinners as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50777:158"/> any other) through the Bryers and is <hi>able to ſave thee to the utmoſt</hi> by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. This hath born up the Spirits of Sinners in their greateſt Agonies. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth when near to Death, is ſaid to comfort himſelf (when in great perplexity about his future ſtate) with this. Chriſt, ſaid he, had a double Title to Heaven, the one in right of his Sonſhip, the other by the merit of his Paſſion, he was content to make uſe of the one for himſelf, and hath left me the other which is all my Claim, and I am ſure that I making this Claim ſhall never be diſappointed. It was St. <hi>Bernards</hi> before: <hi>Satan</hi> is the great Accuſer, and <hi>Chriſt the only Excuſer.</hi> He our Surety, Mediator, Juſtifier, Advocate, he was wont to plead in the Behalf of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, againſt their Accuſers; of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples againſt the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 3. For <hi>Mary</hi> againſt <hi>Martha,</hi> Luke 10. 41. For <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> againſt <hi>Simon,</hi> Luke 7. 40. He fetcht off the Woman taken in Adultery (ready to be ſtoned) with one word ſpeaking. His word goes far and his bloud ſpeaks better things for us then a thouſand Prayers, Tears, Alms, or all our Faith, Repentance, Obedience can do, then the beſt bloud of Martyrs, or all the Interceſſion of Saints and Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50777:158"/> 
                  <hi>Benjamin</hi> might thank God for a good Brother that became Surety for him firſt, and Advocate for him at laſt, that he was brought off ſo well. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> might thank God he had ſuch an Advocate as <hi>Paul</hi> to prevail with his Maſter for his Reception. And we are all bound to give thanks for Jeſus Chriſt who is become our Surety and will be our Advocate. For what once our Saviour ſaid to the obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Jews to the aggravation of their Sin and increaſe of their Condemnation, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, and done the works which no other man did, they had had no Sin, but now they have no Cloak, or Excuſe</hi> (as it is in the Margin) <hi>for their Sin,</hi> that he ſpeaketh to his Servants by way of Conſolation, If I had not come into the world and done and ſuffered that for you which none other could, you had had no Cloak, nor Excuſe for your Sins, but now I am your Surety and Advocate, <hi>I have taken away your Sins,</hi> and ſhall preſent you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in the ſight of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
